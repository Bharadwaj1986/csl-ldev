{@Abhi-praśnin.@}¦ — This term occurs after {@Praśnin,@} and followed
by {@Praśnavivāka@} in the list of victims for the Puruṣamedha
given in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>2</sup>
The commentators, Sāyaṇa and Mahīdhara, see in it merely a
reference to an inquisitive man. But there can be little doubt
that the term must have had a legal reference of some sort — 
perhaps indicating the defendant as opposed to plaintiff and
judge.
