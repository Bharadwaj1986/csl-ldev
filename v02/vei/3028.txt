{@Vṛtra-ghna@}¦ occurs in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup>
where in a {@Gāthā@} reciting the prowess of {@Bharata@} it is said that
he bound horses on the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and {@Gaṅgā@} (Ganges)
{%Vṛtraghne,%} which Sāyaṇa renders ‘at Vṛtraghna,’ as the name
of a place. Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, seems right in interpreting the
form as a dative, ‘for the slayer of Vṛtra’ — {%i.e.,%} Indra.
