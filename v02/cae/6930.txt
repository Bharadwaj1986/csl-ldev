{#कथ꣡म्#}¦ <ab>adv.</ab> how? in what way? whence? <ab>interr.</ab> & <ab>excl.</ab>;
often followed by {#नु ( = कथम्#} alone or = how much more, <ab>w.</ab> neg. how
much less); also by {#इव, नाम, स्विद्#}. With {#चन, चिद्#}, & (later) {#अपि#}
indef. somehow, in any way, scarcely, hardly, a little ({#कथम्#}
sometimes doubled); <ab>w.</ab> a negation ({#कथं चन#} also alone) in no way,
by no means, not at all. {#यथा कथं चिद्#} howsoever, anyhow.
