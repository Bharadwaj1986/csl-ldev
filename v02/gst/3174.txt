as results from wealth, a magisterial position &c.). <sup>2</sup> Cer-

symptoms of the Erotic ({#शृङ्गार#}) are according to them,
motion of the eye-brows, side-glances &c.; of the Comic
({#हास्य#}), blinking with the eye, smiles &c.; of the Pathetic
({#करुण#}), cursing one's fate, falling to the ground, crying
&c.; of the Terrible ({#रौद्र#}), abuse, fierce looks &c.; of the
Heroic ({#वीर#}), looking for a companion &c.; of the Fearful
({#भयानक#}), change of colour, stammering &c.; of the Dis-
gustful ({#बीभत्स#}), spitting, contracting the mouth, shutting
the eyes &c.; of the Wonderful ({#अद्भुत#}), wide opening of
the eyes &c.; of the Quietistic ({#शान्त#}), horripilation (sic)
&c.; of the Affectionate ({#वत्सल#}), horripilation, joy, tears
&c.--Compare {#भाव#} and {#विभाव#}. E. {#अनु#} and {#भाव,#} lit.
‘following or connected with condition, feeling &c.’.
