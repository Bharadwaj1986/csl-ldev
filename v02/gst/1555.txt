{#अथर्य#}¦ m. ({#-र्यः#}) Moving constantly; an epithet of Agni in the
<div n="lb">Vedas. See also the following. E. {#अथर्य्,#} kṛt aff. {#अच्(?)#}.
<div n="lb">A commentary explains, that {#अथर्य#} is an epithet of {#दक्षि-#}
<div n="lb">{#णाग्नि,#} because the sacred fire ‘goes always’ from the Gār-
<div n="lb">hapatya (q. v.) to his proper place; the epithet may be con-
<div n="lb">sidered, however, as one of a more general bearing.
