{#अपुरुषार्थ#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-र्थः#}) <sup>1</sup> (In the Mīmānsā philosophy.)
A religious act which is not performed on account of the
gratification of the sacrificer, but because it is essential to
the sacrifice itself; see {#क्रत्वर्थ#}. <sup>2</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya philos.)
Not the chief object of the Soul; occurring in the Sūtras
in its abstract deriv. {#अपुरुषार्थत्व;#} e. g. {#अपुरुषार्थत्वमुभयथा#}
‘in neither way is (nihilism) the chief end of the Soul’; or
{#नानुश्राविकादपि तत्सिद्धिः साध्यत्वेनावृत्तियोगादपुरुषार्थत्वम्#}
‘the accomplishment thereof (i. e. of liberation) does not
arise, moreover, from scriptural means, for since trans-
migration is connected with the result (of religious acts,
the performance of such acts) is not the chief object of the
Soul’; or {#सुखलाभाभावादपुरुषार्थत्वमिति चेन्न द्वैविध्यात्#} ‘if
you reason that, since there is no such a thing as obtain-
ing happiness, (final liberation as the absence of pain) is not
the chief object of the Soul, you are wrong, for its object
is twofold (viz. obtaining happiness and not having pain)’.
E. {#अ#} neg. and {#पुरुषार्थ#}.
