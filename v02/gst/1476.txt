{#अत्यन्ततिरस्कृतवाच्यध्वनि#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-निः#}) (In rhetoric.)
A metaphorical expression, when the word expressing the fi-
gure or comparison drops its literal sense in order to be-
come appropriate for the comparison; f. i. in the sentence
‘the moon does not shine, like a mirror which has become
blind by breathing upon it’--the word ‘blind’ loses its
literal meaning, to serve as a comparison for ‘the not shin-
ing’ of the moon with which it has no common quality.
E. {#अत्यन्त, तिरस्कृत, वाच्य#} (these three words forming a
Bahuvr.) and {#ध्वनि#}.
