{#अना#}¦ ind. (ved.) Certainly, indeed. (A commentator of the
<div n="lb">Amarakosha considers this particle as a synonyme of the
<div n="lb">negative {#न;#} his opinion rests, however, only on an arti-
<div n="lb">ficial interpretation of the word {#अनावृष्टि#} (q. v.) and is
<div n="lb">refuted by others who explain it as derived, not from {#अना#}
<div n="lb">and {#वृष्टि,#} but from {#अ#} neg. and {#आवृष्टि#}.) E. unknown;
<div n="lb">probably an obsolete third case of the pronominal theme
<div n="lb">{#अ#} (q. v.).
