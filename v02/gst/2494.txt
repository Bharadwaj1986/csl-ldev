<L>2494<pc>075-a<k1>अना<k2>अना
{#अना#}¦ ind. (ved.) Certainly, indeed. (A commentator of the
Amarakosha considers this particle as a synonyme of the
negative {#न;#} his opinion rests, however, only on an arti-
ficial interpretation of the word {#अनावृष्टि#} (q. v.) and is
refuted by others who explain it as derived, not from {#अना#}
and {#वृष्टि,#} but from {#अ#} neg. and {#आवृष्टि#}.) E. unknown;
probably an obsolete third case of the pronominal theme
{#अ#} (q. v.).
