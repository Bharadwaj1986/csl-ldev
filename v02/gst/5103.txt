{#अपान्नपात्#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-त्#}) (ved.) An epithet or name of
<div n="lb">Agni (fire) and Savitri (sun).--{%Sāyaṇa%} explains this word
<div n="lb">as meaning literally either ‘not protecting ({#न-पात्,#} from
<div n="lb">{#पा,#} kṛt aff. {#शतृ#}) or not allowing to fall down ({#न-पात्#}
<div n="lb">from the caus. of {#पत्,#} kṛt aff. {#क्विप्#}) the waters’, fire or
<div n="lb">sun drying up the water; or ‘the grandson of the waters’,
<div n="lb">water bringing forth plants and trees, and plants and trees
<div n="lb">being the cause of fire; the latter explanation, apparently
<div n="lb">more congenial with the vaidik poetry than the former, is
<div n="lb">also given by {%Yāska.%} Comp. {#अप्#} and {#अपान्नप्तृ#}. [The word has
<div n="lb">two accents, viz. the udātta on the second and third syllable
<div n="lb">and is given by the Padatext of the Ṛgveda as representing
<div n="lb">not a compound, but two distinct words; that it may be
<div n="lb">analyzed so, is indubitable from passages where it occurs
<div n="lb">e. g. in the form {#नपातमपाम्#}. On the other hand it must be ob-
<div n="lb">served that the double accent belongs also to other and similar
<div n="lb">Tatpur. mentioned in the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} VI. 2. 140. (comp. e. g.
<div n="lb">{#तनूनपात्#}) and that this Gaṇa would comprise more words
<div n="lb">than those mentioned in the present edition of Pāṇ. and the
<div n="lb">ordinary Gaṇa lists as well as in the Kāśikā, if we may believe
<div n="lb">the {%Svaramañjarī%} of {%Nṛsinha,%} which mentions e. g. {#शुकग्र-#}
<div n="lb">{#न्थिनौ#} (not referring this word to VI. 2. 141.) and concludes
<div n="lb">with {#इत्यादि;#} it may be observed too, that the {%Nighanṭu%}
<div n="lb">mentions {#अपान्नपात्#} as {%one%} of the thirty-two {#पद#} enumerated
<div n="lb">V. 4., and that {%Sāyaṇa%} in his comm. cannot have looked
<div n="lb">upon it otherwise than as a compound when he writes e. g.
<div n="lb">{#अपांनपात्संज्ञकोऽग्निः;#} comp. also the remark of {%Patanjali%}
<div n="lb">s. v. {#अपान्नप्तृ#}. The genitive {%plur.%} as a former part of a com-
<div n="lb">pound, is of rare occurrence, but met with also in other
[Page187-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">compounds beginning with {#अपाम्,#} e. g. {#अपांवत्स, अपान्नाथ,#}
<div n="lb">{#अपाम्पति#} &c. and in the Tatpur. {#देवानांप्रिय#} ({%Pāṇini%} VI. 3. 21.
<div n="lb">{%Vārtt.%} 4.). E. {#अपाम्#} (gen. plur. of {#अप्#}) and {#नपात्#}.
