{#अपान्नपात्#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-त्#}) (ved.) An epithet or name of
Agni (fire) and Savitri (sun).--{%Sāyaṇa%} explains this word
as meaning literally either ‘not protecting ({#न-पात्,#} from
{#पा,#} kṛt aff. {#शतृ#}) or not allowing to fall down ({#न-पात्#}
from the caus. of {#पत्,#} kṛt aff. {#क्विप्#}) the waters’, fire or
sun drying up the water; or ‘the grandson of the waters’,
water bringing forth plants and trees, and plants and trees
being the cause of fire; the latter explanation, apparently
more congenial with the vaidik poetry than the former, is
also given by {%Yāska.%} Comp. {#अप्#} and {#अपान्नप्तृ#}. [The word has
two accents, viz. the udātta on the second and third syllable
and is given by the Padatext of the Ṛgveda as representing
not a compound, but two distinct words; that it may be
analyzed so, is indubitable from passages where it occurs
e. g. in the form {#नपातमपाम्#}. On the other hand it must be ob-
served that the double accent belongs also to other and similar
Tatpur. mentioned in the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} VI. 2. 140. (comp. e. g.
{#तनूनपात्#}) and that this Gaṇa would comprise more words
than those mentioned in the present edition of Pāṇ. and the
ordinary Gaṇa lists as well as in the Kāśikā, if we may believe
the {%Svaramañjarī%} of {%Nṛsinha,%} which mentions e. g. {#शुकग्र-#}
{#न्थिनौ#} (not referring this word to VI. 2. 141.) and concludes
with {#इत्यादि;#} it may be observed too, that the {%Nighanṭu%}
mentions {#अपान्नपात्#} as {%one%} of the thirty-two {#पद#} enumerated
V. 4., and that {%Sāyaṇa%} in his comm. cannot have looked
upon it otherwise than as a compound when he writes e. g.
{#अपांनपात्संज्ञकोऽग्निः;#} comp. also the remark of {%Patanjali%}
s. v. {#अपान्नप्तृ#}. The genitive {%plur.%} as a former part of a com-
pound, is of rare occurrence, but met with also in other
[Page187-a+ 56]
compounds beginning with {#अपाम्,#} e. g. {#अपांवत्स, अपान्नाथ,#}
{#अपाम्पति#} &c. and in the Tatpur. {#देवानांप्रिय#} ({%Pāṇini%} VI. 3. 21.
{%Vārtt.%} 4.). E. {#अपाम्#} (gen. plur. of {#अप्#}) and {#नपात्#}.
