{#अपिकक्ष्य#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-क्ष्यम्#}) (ved.) A ligature or bandage
for rejoining with the {#कक्ष#} (which word seems to mean in
this case, {%shoulder%}) scil. the head. This word occurs in
the {%Ṛgv.%} I. 117. 22., where the mystic science given by Da-
dhyach to the Aśvins as a reward for having replaced his
head, when it was cut off, with a horse's head, is called
or likened to, a bandage, because, as {%Sāyaṇa%} interprets,
it became the means by which the cut-off head was rejoined
with the shoulder part. E. {#अपि#} and {#कक्ष्य#}.
