{#अपकर्षसम#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-मः-मा#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
<div n="lb">The sophism of the non-existence of qualities; viz. arguing,
<div n="lb">that because two things have one quality not in common,
<div n="lb">they will have none in common; e. g. sound and a jar being
<div n="lb">both artificially produced are perishable; now the sophism
<div n="lb">in question would consist in concluding: that because sound
<div n="lb">has not the quality of shape, which belongs to jar, or because
<div n="lb">a jar does not refer to the sense of hearing as sound does,
<div n="lb">sound and jar are neither artificially produced nor perishable.
<div n="lb">E. {#अपकर्ष#} and {#सम#}. (With respect to the gender of this word
<div n="lb">and the ellipsis required to explain it, see the E. of {#अनित्यसम#}.)
