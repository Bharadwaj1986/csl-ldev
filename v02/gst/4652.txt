{#अपपित्व#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-त्वम्#}) (ved.) Going away from, sever-
ance. E. {#आप्#} with {#अप,#} kṛt aff. {#त्वन्;#} (in analogy with
the etym. of {#सपित्व#} as given by {%Sāyaṇa;%} but {%Benfey%}--s. v.
{#प्रपित्व#} in his Glossary to the Sāmaveda--is probably more
correct in referring this and similar formations to a radical
{#अप्#} (comp. the E. of {#अप्त#}). The compound is irregular on
account of the short vowel of the second syllable and belongs,
in this respect, to the class of {#कर्कन्धु, शकन्धु, सीमन्त#} &c.).
