{#अन्नमयकोश#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-शः#}) The sheath made of {#अन्न#} 2. 2.,
of the essence of the elementary creation, i. e. the material
creation: the lowest form in which Brahman (n.) or the
Supreme Soul is considered as manifesting itself in its world-
ly and conscious existence.--In the Taittirīya-Upan. {#अन्न#}
of which the material creation is made, is the product of
herbs, these of earth and so on in retrogression, of the
elements water, fire and æther, the latter being the first
product of the Supreme Soul; it would appear therefore
that Brahman (n.) as {#अन्नमयकोश,#} in this Upanishad,
[Page136-a+ 56]
is the totality of the {%animal kingdom%} only, since the vegetable
kingdom precedes the creation of {#अन्न#} which is called also
{#सर्वौषध#} (see {#अन्न#} 2. 2.) and the beings ({#प्रजाः#} or {#भूतानि#})
originating in {#अन्न,#} are represented as {%living%} through it
({#‘अथोऽनेनैव जीवन्ति’#}); but as {#अन्न#} on the other hand,
is the essence of the elements preceding it, this form of
Brahman would become in the Upanishad, constructively,
the same that it is in the Vedānta explicitly, viz. the to-
tality of the whole material creation. Yet while the Upa-
nishad uses the terms æther, air, fire, water and earth to
denote the elements in a general sense, the Vedānta dis-
tinguishes between ideal ({#सूक्ष्म#}) and real ({#स्थूल#}) elements
and makes the {#अन्नमयकोश#} proceed from the latter which
are an artificial mutual combination of portions of the former
(see {#भूत, सूक्ष्मभूत#} and {#स्थूलभूत#}); and while the Upanishad
contents itself with the general idea of totality, as expressed
above, the Vedānta distinguishes between the conception
that may be formed of the Supreme Soul as unity in this
totality of the material creation (comp. {#समष्टि#}) and the con-
ception that may be formed of it as multiplicity in it (comp.
{#व्यष्टि#}); as unity it is called {#वैश्वानर#} or {#विराज्,#} as multi-
plicity {#विश्व,#} in either case it is {#जाग्रत्#}.--The forms superior
to the {#अन्नमयकोश#} are in successive gradation {#प्राणमयकोश,#}
{#मनोमयकोश, विज्ञानमयकोश#} and {#आनन्दमयकोश#} qq. vv.
(the word {#कोश#} being supplied, in the Upanishad, by the
comm. to {#अन्नमय#} &c.). Compare also {#सूक्ष्मशरीर#} and {#स्थू-#}
{#लशरीर#}. E. {#अन्नमय#} and {#कोश#}. Also written {#अन्नमयकोष#}.
