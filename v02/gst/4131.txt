{#अन्नमयकोश#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-शः#}) The sheath made of {#अन्न#} 2. 2.,
<div n="lb">of the essence of the elementary creation, i. e. the material
<div n="lb">creation: the lowest form in which Brahman (n.) or the
<div n="lb">Supreme Soul is considered as manifesting itself in its world-
<div n="lb">ly and conscious existence.--In the Taittirīya-Upan. {#अन्न#}
<div n="lb">of which the material creation is made, is the product of
<div n="lb">herbs, these of earth and so on in retrogression, of the
<div n="lb">elements water, fire and æther, the latter being the first
<div n="lb">product of the Supreme Soul; it would appear therefore
<div n="lb">that Brahman (n.) as {#अन्नमयकोश,#} in this Upanishad,
[Page136-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">is the totality of the {%animal kingdom%} only, since the vegetable
<div n="lb">kingdom precedes the creation of {#अन्न#} which is called also
<div n="lb">{#सर्वौषध#} (see {#अन्न#} 2. 2.) and the beings ({#प्रजाः#} or {#भूतानि#})
<div n="lb">originating in {#अन्न,#} are represented as {%living%} through it
<div n="lb">({#‘अथोऽनेनैव जीवन्ति’#}); but as {#अन्न#} on the other hand,
<div n="lb">is the essence of the elements preceding it, this form of
<div n="lb">Brahman would become in the Upanishad, constructively,
<div n="lb">the same that it is in the Vedānta explicitly, viz. the to-
<div n="lb">tality of the whole material creation. Yet while the Upa-
<div n="lb">nishad uses the terms æther, air, fire, water and earth to
<div n="lb">denote the elements in a general sense, the Vedānta dis-
<div n="lb">tinguishes between ideal ({#सूक्ष्म#}) and real ({#स्थूल#}) elements
<div n="lb">and makes the {#अन्नमयकोश#} proceed from the latter which
<div n="lb">are an artificial mutual combination of portions of the former
<div n="lb">(see {#भूत, सूक्ष्मभूत#} and {#स्थूलभूत#}); and while the Upanishad
<div n="lb">contents itself with the general idea of totality, as expressed
<div n="lb">above, the Vedānta distinguishes between the conception
<div n="lb">that may be formed of the Supreme Soul as unity in this
<div n="lb">totality of the material creation (comp. {#समष्टि#}) and the con-
<div n="lb">ception that may be formed of it as multiplicity in it (comp.
<div n="lb">{#व्यष्टि#}); as unity it is called {#वैश्वानर#} or {#विराज्,#} as multi-
<div n="lb">plicity {#विश्व,#} in either case it is {#जाग्रत्#}.--The forms superior
<div n="lb">to the {#अन्नमयकोश#} are in successive gradation {#प्राणमयकोश,#}
<div n="lb">{#मनोमयकोश, विज्ञानमयकोश#} and {#आनन्दमयकोश#} qq. vv.
<div n="lb">(the word {#कोश#} being supplied, in the Upanishad, by the
<div n="lb">comm. to {#अन्नमय#} &c.). Compare also {#सूक्ष्मशरीर#} and {#स्थू-#}
<div n="lb">{#लशरीर#}. E. {#अन्नमय#} and {#कोश#}. Also written {#अन्नमयकोष#}.
