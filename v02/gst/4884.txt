{#अपल्यूलनकृत#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-तः-ता-तम्#}) Not cleaned with
alkaline substances (as the garment of a man who is initiated
for a sacrifice).--The present edition of the {%Śatapathabr.%}
where the word occurs (III. 1. 2. 19.), gives it in the shape
[Page175-b+ 56]
of {#अपल्पूलनकृत,#} but although it may be difficult sometimes
to distinguish a {#य्#} from a {#प्#} in Devanāg. Mss., the form
{#अपल्यू°#} is doubtless the correct one, since the reading of the
radical {#पल्यूल्#} (wherefrom {#पल्यूलनं = शोधनद्रव्यम्#} Mādhava)
is safe through its occurring also in Beṅgāli writing.--
E. {#अ#} neg. and {#पल्यूलन-कृत#}.
