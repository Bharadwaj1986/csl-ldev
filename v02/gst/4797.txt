{#अपरिग्रह#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-हः#}) <sup>1</sup> Non-encompassing, non-com-
prehension; e. g. in the {%Vedānta Sūtra:%} {#अपरिग्रहाच्चात्यन्त-#}
{#मनपेक्षा#}. <sup>2</sup> Non-acceptance. In the latter sense this word
has assumed a special bearing in the {%Yoga%} philosophy and
in such passages of the {%Upan.%} and other writings (compare
e. g. {%Wilson's Viṣṇup.%} p. 288. n. 2), as refer to the doctrine
of this philosophy; it means there: {%renouncing every thing%}
{%that can afford enjoyment,%} as a commentator observes,
from the perception of the defects that inhere in mundane
objects, as they must be acquired, preserved, as they pe-
rish, produce affection and cause the infliction of injury
({%Bhojadeva:%} {#अपरिग्रहो भोगसाधनानामस्वीकरणम्;#} another:
{#विषयाणामर्जनरक्षणक्षयसङ्गहिंसादोषदर्शनादस्वीकरणमपरि-#}
{#ग्रहः#}); it is in the Yoga phil. the last of the five categories of
the term {#यम#} q. v., the latter being one of the eight Angas
or constituent parts of the Yoga (see {#योगाङ्ग#}). Renun-
ciation however must be understood there in its widest sense,
also as indifference to one's own body, since the soul's as-
suming a body is also {#परिग्रह#} or covetousness, for body
is the instrument of enjoyment and passion is connected
with it; and only the Yogin who is firm in the renun-
ciation in this widest sense, obtains a knowledge of the
condition of former and subsequent existences: {#अपरिग्र-#}
{#हस्थैर्ये जन्मकथन्तासंबोधः#} ({%Bhojadeva:%} {#…न केवलं भोग-#}
{#साधनपरिग्रह एव परिग्रहः । किंतु यावदात्मनः शरीरग्रही#}
{#ऽपि परिग्रहः । भोगसाधनत्वाच्छरीरस्य तस्मिन्सति रागानु-#}
{#बन्धात् । वहिर्मुखायामेव प्रवृत्तौ न तात्त्विकज्ञानप्रादुर्भावः ।#}
{#यदा पुनः शरीरादिपरिग्रहनैरपेक्ष्येण माध्यस्थ्यमालम्बते तदा#}
{#मध्यस्थस्य रागादित्यागात्सम्यग्ज्ञानहेतुर्भवत्येव पूर्वापरजन्मसं-#}
{#बोधः#}). ({%Jayamangala%} in his comm. on {%Bhaṭṭik.%} 1. 15. calls the
fifth {#यम,#} contrary to the {%Yoga S.,%} {#अकल्मष,#} equally so {%Hari-%}
{%hara;%} but {%Vidyāvinodāchārya%} names it correctly in his comm.
{#अपरिग्रह#}.)--The comm. on the {%Sāṅkhya%} phil., while re-
taining the definition of {#यम#} as given by Patanjali, have
made {#यम#} one of the four categories of {#धर्म#} (q. v.), righte-
ousness, {#धर्म#} being in the Sāṅkhya one of the four categories
of {#बुद्धि#} (q. v.), intellect, when it is {#सात्विक#} or under the in-
fluence of the quality of goodness. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#परिग्रह#}.
