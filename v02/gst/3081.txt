{#अनुपलब्धिसम#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-मः-मा#}) (In the Nyāya philo-
sophy.) A sophism on non-perception; viz. arguing: ‘be-
cause the non-perception of an object cannot be perceived,
therefore the non-perception of the object does not exist
[Page093-b+ 56]
and consequently the non-existence of the object cannot
exist i. e. the object itself must exist’. This sophism is at-
tributed by the Nyāya e. g. to those who maintain the eter-
nity of sound on the ground that ‘the non-perception of
sound antecedently to pronunciation’--the reason alleged
by the Nyāya for its non-eternity--may be refuted in
the manner explained. E. {#अनुपलब्धि#} and {#सम#} (m. scil.
{#प्रतिषेध#} or {#विकल्प#} or {#प्रयोग;#} f. scil. {#जाति;#} comp. for the
meaning of these words the E. of {#अनित्यसम#}).
