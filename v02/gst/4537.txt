{#अपचमान#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-नः#}) A man whose mode of life does
not allow him to cook for himself; {%Kullūka%} names as such
the religious student, the religious mendicant, heretics and
such like people ({#‘अपचमाना ब्राह्मचारिपरिव्राजकाः पाष-#}
{#ण्डादयः’#}); he observes however that the ‘heretics &c.’ are
included in the definition by {%Medhātithi%} and {%Govindarāja%} who
impart this bearing to {#अपचमान#} in Manu 4. 32, while ac-
cording to his own opinion the word would rather refer in
this passage to the {#स्नातक#} or initiated householder than to
the ‘heretic &c.’--Comp. {#अपच#}. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#पचमान#}.
