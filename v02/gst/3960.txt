{#अन्तिकाश्रय#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-यः#}) <sup>1</sup> A contiguous support, as
<div n="lb">that given by a tree to a creeper &c. <sup>2</sup> The house of a
<div n="lb">neighbour (according to Hemachandra's Abhidh. 4. 67. (=
<div n="lb">v. 1001), where the two words {#उपघ्न#} and {#अन्तिकाश्रय#} are
<div n="lb">explained by Vallabhagaṇi: {#पाडोसीघरनाम्नी द्वे;#} but the
<div n="lb">quotation added by this comm. from Raghuvanśa 14. 1. would
<div n="lb">rather refer to the first meaning than qualify a house, as
<div n="lb">seems required by the context in which these words occur
<div n="lb">in Hemachandra). E. {#अन्तिक#} and {#आश्रय#}.
