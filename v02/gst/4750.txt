{#अपरस्परसम्भूत#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-तः-ता-तम्#}) Produced by or
in an uninterrupted series. (The verse of the {%Bhagavadgītā%}
(16. 8.) where this word occurs: {#‘असत्यमप्रतिष्ठं ते जगदाहु-#}
{#रनीश्वरम् । अपरस्परसंभूतं किमन्यत्कामहैतुकम् ।’#} is to be
rendered, in my opinion, thus: ‘they (the men of demoniac
nature) affirm that the world is devoid of truth, of stability
and without a Lord (a creator): but does there exist any thing
else, that is produced by (or in) an uninterrupted series, and
yet is the effect of arbitrariness?’; the uninterrupted series
being that of causes and effects according to the Sāṅkhya-
[Page169-b+ 56]
Yoga doctrine of the successive developement of the world.)
E. {#अपरस्पर#} and {#सम्भूत#}.
