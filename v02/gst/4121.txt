<div n="lb">child: the seventh of the ten essential rites enjoined to the
<div n="lb">the three first castes (see {#संस्कार#}); it ought to take place
<div n="lb">according to Āsvālāyana, Manu, Yājnavalkya &c. in the
<div n="lb">sixth month after a child's birth; according to Kātyāyana
<div n="lb">and his school in the sixth (or, according to some, in the
<div n="lb">eighth month) if the child is a boy, in the fifth or seventh,
<div n="lb">if it is a girl. According to Āsvālāyana a father, if he
<div n="lb">desire plenty (for his child?) ought to give it a soup or
<div n="lb">sauce made of goat's flesh ({#‘आजमन्नाद्यकामः’#}); if he de-
<div n="lb">sire holiness, a soup or sauce made of the flesh of a fran-
<div n="lb">coline patridge, called tittiri ({#‘तैत्तिरं ब्रह्मवर्चसकामः’#}); if
<div n="lb">he desire strength, boiled rice sprinkled over with very
<div n="lb">little clarified butter, but not fried in butter, as it would
<div n="lb">then not be moist ({#‘घृतौदनं तेजस्कामः’#}) [The restriction
<div n="lb">made by the comm. in his explanation of the word {#घृतौदन#}
<div n="lb">is not justified by himself, but countenanced by the gloss of
<div n="lb">Patanjali on a Vārttika ({#‘संप्रत्ययाच्च तदर्थाध्यवसानम्’#}) to
<div n="lb">Pāṇini II. 1. 34]; or if he have no particular desire, boiled
<div n="lb">rice mixed with curdled milk, honey and clarified butter
<div n="lb">({#‘दधिमधुघृतमिश्रमन्नं प्राशयेत्’#}). [The word {#अन्न#} supplied
<div n="lb">at {#आज#} and {#तैत्तिर#} is, as the comm. observes, not to be
<div n="lb">taken there in its usual sense ‘boiled rice’ but in that of
<div n="lb">soup or sauce, {#व्यञ्जन#}.] When giving the food, whatever
<div n="lb">be its substance, the father speaks the verse: {#अन्नपतेऽन्नस्य#}
<div n="lb">{#नो देह्यनमीवस्य शुष्मिणः#} &c. (Vājas. Sanh. 11. 83.), if the
<div n="lb">child is a boy; if it is a girl, the ceremony is performed
<div n="lb">without the recital of the mantra ({#‘आवृतैव कुमार्यै’#}).--
<div n="lb">According to the school of Kātyāyana the food varies still
<div n="lb">more according to the nature of the desires: that cor-
<div n="lb">responding with the desire of eloquence is the flesh (pro-
<div n="lb">bably the sauce made of the flesh of) a skylark ({#भरद्वाजी#});
<div n="lb">with the desire of plenty, that of a partridge, called {#क-#}
<div n="lb">{#पिञ्जल;#} with the desire of quickness that of a fish; with
<div n="lb">the desire of long life that of the partridge called {#कृकणा;#}
<div n="lb">with the desire of holiness that of the Śaralī bird ({#आटी#});
<div n="lb">with the desire of all the advantages mentioned before that
<div n="lb">of all these animals together; the dish must moreover in
<div n="lb">general contain honey, clarified butter and bits of gold
<div n="lb">(Reṇuka in his Gṛhyakārikā: {#‘मध्वाज्यकनकोपेतं सर्वं तद्युग-#}
<div n="lb">{#पत्प्रभुः । मांसं तच्च भरद्वाज्या यदीच्छेद्वाक्प्रसारिताम् । का-#}
<div n="lb">{#पिञ्जलं चेदन्नाद्यं मात्स्यं च जवनं यदि । आयुश्चेत्कृकणायाश्च#}
<div n="lb">{#तदाट्याश्चेद्ब्रह्मवर्चसम् । सर्वं चेत्सर्वमांसानि सहान्नं प्राशयेच्छु-#}
<div n="lb">{#भम्’#}); the ceremony is performed while a mantra is in-
<div n="lb">audibly muttered and the child is sitting on the lap of its
<div n="lb">mother before the divinity of the family; preparatory pro-
<div n="lb">cedings are, according to Reṇuka, those connected with
<div n="lb">the fixing of an auspicious day, the Ābhyudayika-śrāddha
<div n="lb">(the same as the Vṛddhi-Śr.), austerities, as suspending
<div n="lb">the breath, meditation on the divinity and oblations (āhutis)
<div n="lb">with clarified butter while remembering the divine powers
<div n="lb">of speech ({#वाच्#}), the vital airs {#प्राण#} and {#अपान,#} eye
<div n="lb">({#चक्षुस्#}) and ear ({#श्रोत्र#}), lastly an oblation of {#चरु#} (q. v.)
<div n="lb">to Agni ({#अग्निः स्विष्टकृत्#}).--According to Bhavadeva, as
<div n="lb">quoted by Rādhākānta, the order of the procedings is:
<div n="lb">fixing of an auspicious day, ablutions, performance of the
<div n="lb">Vṛddhi-Śrāddha, collecting of the sacrificial fire, making
[Page135-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">a heap of Kuśagrass(?) (acc. to Reṇuka: of fifty leaves of
<div n="lb">this grass), then silently throwing into the fire a piece of
<div n="lb">fuel smeared with clarified butter, of a span's length, then
<div n="lb">the oblation (homa) which is accompanied with the three
<div n="lb">sacred words bhūr, bhuvar and svar, then five oblations
<div n="lb">(āhutis) with clarified butter, then the homa of the five vital
<div n="lb">airs ({#प्राण#}), or instead of the two latter(?) the ceremony
<div n="lb">practised in the north which begins with the Śāṭyāyana-
<div n="lb">homa and ends with the hymn called Vāmadevya; these
<div n="lb">procedings are followed by the essential rite of giving the
<div n="lb">food and by, what is essential too, the presents to the of-
<div n="lb">ficiating priest. (Comp. also {#अन्नभुक्ति#}.) E. {#अन्न#} and {#प्राशन#}.
