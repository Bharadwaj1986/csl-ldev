{#अन्वच्#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-न्वङ्-नूची-न्वक्; न्वञ्चम्-नूचीम्-न्वक्;#}
{#नूचा-नूच्या-नूचा#} &c.; du. {#न्वञ्चौ-नूच्यौ-नूची;#} plur. {#-न्वञ्चः-नूच्यः#}
{#-न्वञ्चि; नूचः-नूचीः-न्वञ्चि#} &c.) <sup>1</sup> Following; {#अनूचि#} (loc. sing.),
behind, from behind; e. g. {#आगच्छतोऽनूचि गजस्य घण्टयोः#}
{#स्वनं समाकर्ण्य समाकुलाङ्गनाः#} &c. (comm. {#अनूचि पृष्ठदेशे#}).
<sup>2</sup> (ved.) Going along or lengthwise; as opposed to {#उदच्#} and
{#तिर्यच्#} qq. vv.--The neuter {#अन्वक्#} is used as adv. and as-
sumes in conjunction with {#भूत्वा#} or in composition with {#भूय#}
and {#भावम्#} (see {#अन्वग्भावम्#}) the meaning of ‘friendly or
favourably disposed’. [Pāṇini, in the rule III. 4. 64. makes
uses of the form {#अन्वचि#} which has the value there of a
locat. of {#अन्वच्;#} Patanjali blames him for this liberty: {#अ-#}
{#युक्तोऽयं निर्देशः । अनूचीति भवितव्यम् । सौत्रोऽयं निर्देशः ।#}.
But as Pāṇini expresses himself in a similar manner when
speaking of {#तिर्यच्#} III. 4. 60. {#‘तिर्यच्यपवर्गे’#}--when he in-
curs a like remark from Patanjali--, it is perhaps more
just to say that he did not intend to speak in these rules
of the declinable {#अन्वच्#} and {#तिर्यच्,#} but of their neuters
become indeclinable; and that, his method requiring in these
rules the locative of the mentioned words, {#अन्वचि#} and {#ति-#}
{#र्यचि#} were less objectionable than {#अन्वकि#} and {#तिर्यकि,#} while
{#अनूचि#} and {#तिरश्चि,#} as suggested by Patanjali, would not
have necessarily conveyed the notion of indeclinable words.]
E. {#अच्#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#क्विन्#}.
