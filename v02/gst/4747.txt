{#अपरसक्थ#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-क्थम्#}) (ved.) The part over the thigh
(according to {%Sāyaṇa%}). [The gender of this word is neuter
--comp. {%Pāṇ.%} V. 4. 98.--, not masc., as might be inferred
from the present publication of so called {%‘Extracts’%} from
{%Sāyaṇa'%}s comm. on the {%Śatapathabr.,%} in the passage III. 8.
3. 27; for although the Ms. 657 of the E. I. H. is very incor-
rect, it does not read {#सक्थ्यो,#} as has been alleged, but some
other mutilated form intended probably for {#सक्थ्नोः;#} it runs
literally thus: {#ऊर्वोरुपरि भूतौ उछ्रितावपवो#} (sic) {#साछ्र्यो ।#}
(the {#छ्य#} representing in this Ms. the value of {#थ्य#} and the {#आ-ओ#}
that of {#ओ#}).] E. {#अपर#} (see I. 1. 3.) and {#सक्थि,#} samās. aff. {#टच्#}.
