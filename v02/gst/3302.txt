{#अनुवंश#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-शः#}) <sup>1</sup> A genealogical table, a song
embodying such tables or lists. (A comm. renders this word
simply with {#गाथा#} ‘a song’ and {#अनुवंश्य#} with {#गातव्य;#} the
meaning ‘song’ however seems too general and would not
always convey a distinct meaning of {#अनुवंश#}.)
<div n="P">II. Avyayībh. ({#-शम्#}) According to the families or races.
(The word {#आनुवंश्य#} is derived from the Avyayībh., not
from the Tatpur.) E. {#अनु#} and {#वंश#} (the E. of I. 1. however
according to the comm. mentioned, would have to be in
conformity with that given of {#वंश, वम्#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#श#}).
