{#अनुनासिक#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-कः-का-कम्#}) (In Grammar.) Uttered
through the nose, nasal (see also {#रक्त#}), viz. <sup>1</sup> A nasal sound
in general, it being pronounced through the nose and with
the appropriate organ of speech, as {#ङ्#} through the nose
and the throat, {#ञ्#} through the nose and with the palate &c.
<sup>2</sup> (Conditionally) a vowel or {#य्, व्, ल्;#} in this case the nasal
nature of the sound is indicated by the sign {#ंँ#}. (N. B. {#य्ंँ#} or
{#व्ंँ#} represent the value of {#य्#} or {#व्#} preceded by {#म्; ल्ंँ#} that
of {#ल्#} preceded by {#म्#} or {#न्#}. In the pause a final vowel may
be anunāsika. A {%short%} anunāsika vowel, when not occurr-
ing in a pause, represents apparently always the value of
the same vowel and {#म्#} or {#न्;#} it must be, in general, the
last vowel sound of the former part of a compound or of
the word itself, followed by a final sibilant, e. g. {#संँस्कर्ता#}
instead of {#सम्स्-कर्ता, पुंँश्चली = पुम्स्-चली, तस्मिंँस्त्वा =#}
{#तस्मिन्स्-त्वा#}. Only a few exceptions of this rule are mentioned
by the vaidik grammarians, e. g. {#अमिनन्तंँ एवैः,#} when {#अ#} of {#न्त#}
is anunāsika, although it does neither stand in a pause nor
represent more than its own sound.--A {%long%} anunāsika
vowel, when not occurring in a pause, may be generally
considered as representing the value of its short vowel and
an original {#न्त्स्#} or of its short vowel and {#न्त्,#} provided {#स्#} or
its substitute has been preserved; e. g. {#महांँ इन्द्रः = महन्त्स्#}
{#इन्द्रः, दधन्वांँ यः = दधन्वन्त्स् यः, सर्गांँ इव = सर्गन्त्स् इव#}
or {#महांँश्चरति = महन्त्स् चरति, दस्यूंँरेकः = दस्युन्त्स् एकः#}.
The material difference that prevails between the anunāsika
({#ंँ#}) and the anusvāra ({#ं#}) sound, does not appear to have
been kept alive beyond the period of the vaidik literature,
when an interchange between both was not deemed legiti-
mate; according to the grammarians of the classical period,
in the latter the anunāsika may be replaced by the anu-
svāra. The sign of the anunāsika ({#ंँ#}), however, is but
seldom met with in the ordinary Mss. referring to the post-
vaidik literature; and from the reasons stated, its use in
vaidik Mss. is objectionable, when it occurs in words like
{#यशांँसि, धनूंँषि, विश्वेषांँ हितः#} or in {#मंँहिष्ठ, वाजंँ सनिषत्, इन्द्रंँ#}
{#स्तवाम#} and similar instances in which the long nasal vowel
does not represent more than the value of a short vowel
and a nasal, or in which the short nasal vowel is not fol-
lowed by a final sibilant.) E. {#अनु#} and {#नासिका#}.
