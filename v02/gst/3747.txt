{#अन्तदीपक#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-कम्#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of the
<div n="lb">alaṅkāras or modes of writing or speaking elegantly, a
<div n="lb">variety of the alaṅkāra {#दीपक#} q. v.; viz. when a variegated
<div n="lb">description reposes on, and is illustrated as it were by, a
<div n="lb">verb which is placed at the end of the sentence. (It would
<div n="lb">seem that the injunction of the principal rhetorical works
<div n="lb">according to which there must be several verbs and but
<div n="lb">one subject in a {#दीपक#} has not been considered as absolute,
<div n="lb">as results from this instance: {#स गिरिं तरुषण्डमण्डितं#}
<div n="lb">{#समवाप्य त्वरया लतामृगः । स्मितदर्शितकार्यनिश्चयः कपिसै-#}
<div n="lb">{#न्यैर्मुदितैरमण्डयत्#} where there is but one verb viz. {#अमण्ड-#}
<div n="lb">{#यत्#} which has the properties required in this {#दीपक#}. Com-
<div n="lb">pare also {#आदिदीपक, मध्यदीपक, प्रतीपदीपक#} and {#मालादी-#}
<div n="lb">{#पक#}.) E. {#अन्त#} and {#दीपक#}.
