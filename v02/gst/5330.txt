{#अप्तु#}¦ m. ({#-प्तुः#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Soma. <sup>2</sup> A sacrificial animal. <sup>3</sup> Body.
<sup>4</sup> A desired object, or object of desire (perhaps more cor-
rectly: attainment, scil. of a desired object). <sup>5</sup> Possessing,
comprising. [The two first meanings are two various inter-
pretations of the word in {%Vājas.%} 5. 35. or {%Śatap.%} III. 6. 3. 8.:
{#जुषाणो अप्तुराज्यस्य वेतु#} (quoted also by the {%Kāśikā%} on {%Pāṇ.%}
VI. 1. 118.), viz. {%Śayaṇa:%} {#अप्तुः सूक्ष्मरूपः सोमः,#} or {%Mahīdh.:%}
{#अप्तुश्चात्र सोमः । आप्नोति पीतः सञ्छरीरम्#} i. e. ‘Soma, be-
cause it comes into the body’; and {%Nṛsinha%} in the {%Swara-%}
{%mañjarī:%} {#अप्तुर्यज्ञियः पशुः#} (probably as connected with
{#अप्तस्#}); the third meaning is that given by {%-Bhaṭṭojid.%} on
the {%Uṇ. Sūtra%} 1. 74. (perhaps because body is pervaded by
Soma); the fourth meaning results from {%Bhaṭṭoj.'%}s {%Prauḍham.%}
but belongs apparently to the word only in {#अप्तोर्याम#} q. v.
where it would have also the fifth meaning, according to a
passage from the Śatap. quoted s. v. {#अप्तोर्याम;#} in either
of the last two meanings {#अप्तोः#} represents probably the
{%abl.%} of the abstract noun in {#-तु#} which in the Vedas often
assumes the function of our infinitive, expressed in the
classical idiom by the accus. {#-तुम्, अप्तोस्#} being thus equal
in value to the classical {#आप्तुम्#}.] E. {#आप्#} with shortened
{#आ#} (accord. to the native etym., but more correctly {#अप्,#}
comp. the etym. of {#अप्त#}), uṇ. aff. {#तु#}.
