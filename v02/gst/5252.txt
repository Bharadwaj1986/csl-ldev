{#अपूरणी#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-णी#}) The silk cotton tree (Bombax
heptaphyllum). E. {#अ#} compar. or explet. and {#पूरणी#}. (A
ludicrous and ungrammatical explanation which is given
of this word, viz. ‘not fit for the woof’, is simply refuted
by the circumstance that {#पूरणी#} means the same as {#अपू-#}
{#रणी;#} the first part of the comp. is the explet. or compar.
{#अ#} which occurs in {#अपटी, अनिक्षु, अनेडमूक, अकुप्य#} and
several other compounds.)
