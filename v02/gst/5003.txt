{#अपस्मार#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-रः#}) (In Medicine.) Epilepsy, falling
sickness; according to {%Suśruta,%} of four kinds, the three
first produced by the derangement of air, bile and phlegm,
the fourth by the combination of the three. (A definition
of {%Ātreya%} is: {#पित्तं रक्तं मरुच्छेष्मा उदानः कुपितो भृशम् ।#}
{#प्राणः शिरसि संकुप्य कुरुते नष्टचेष्टताम्#}.) In Rhetoric it is
mentioned as a {#व्यभिचारिभाव#} or an accessory condition of
the Erotic ({#शृङ्गार#}), Pathetic ({#करुण#}), the Fearful ({#भयानक#})
and the Disgustful ({#बीभत्म#}), and is defined--but happily
this definition has not guided the Hindu poets in the re-
presentation of their characters--as ‘dementation caused
by the planets or similar evil influences and causing falls,
trembling, perspiration, foaming at the mouth, slavering
&c.’. E. {#स्मृ#} with {#अप,#} kṛt aff. {#घञ्#}.
