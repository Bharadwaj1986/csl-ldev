{#अथर्वाङ्गिरस्#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-राः#}) The Angiras of the Athar-
vaveda. This use of the word, as a Tatpur. in the sing.,
is of later origin than that of the Dwandwa in the plur.,
and, as it seems, adopted to explain the form {#अथर्वाङ्गि-#}
{#रस#} q. v.
<div n="P">II. Dwandwa. m. pl. ({#-रसः#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of Athar-
van and of Angiras. <sup>2</sup> The Atharvaveda hymns of both
collectively; the Atharvaveda (q. v.), one part (or parvan)
of which is considered to have been revealed by the descen-
dants of Atharvan and another by the descendants of An-
giras. According to another explanation, however, this
name of the Atharvaveda would merely refer to Atharvan
(q. v.) being the inspired author of one part and Angiras
(q. v.) of the other. E. {#अथर्वन्#} and {#अङ्गिरस्#}.
