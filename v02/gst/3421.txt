{#अनुषुक#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-कः#}) Probably the epithet of a divinity;
the same as {#आनुषुक#}. (Some read instead of this word {#अनु-#}
{#सूयक#} which seems to be wrong, others {#अनुषूक#} which is
doubtful. Compare also {#आनुसुक#}.) E. The Gaṇaratnama-
hodadhi derives {#अनुषुक#} from {#अनुसू#} and {#क#} (from {#कै#}) with
a short vowel before {#कः अनुषुवतीति अनुषू । तं कायतीति#}
{#अनुषुक । केऽण इति ह्रस्वत्वे;#} this application, however, of
Pāṇ. VII. 4. 13. to the etym. given, seems very objectionable.
