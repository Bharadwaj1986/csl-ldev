{#अध्यवसान#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Determining, ascertaining. <sup>2</sup> Effort,
energy. <sup>3</sup> (In rhetoric.) The simple enunciation of elliptic
or figurative speech without qualifying it by epithets &c.,
as it were, leaving it on its own effort; such sentences as
{#श्वेतो धावति#} ‘the white (horse) gallops’, {#कुन्ताः प्रविशन्ति#}
‘(men with) lances enter’ (see also under {#अजहत्स्वार्था#}), or
{#कलिङ्गः साहसिकः#} ‘the (inhabitant of) Kalinga is impetuous’
(see also under {#जहत्स्वार्था#}) would be lakṣaṇās or elliptic
expressions by {#अध्यवसान,#} while {#अश्वः श्वेतो धावति#} the
white horse gallops, {#एते कुन्ताः प्रविशन्ति#} these (men with)
lances enter, {#कलिङ्गः पुरुषो युध्यते#} the man (inhabitant of)
Kalinga fights would be qualified or lakṣaṇās by {#आरोप#}
q. v. (See also under {#लक्षणा#}.) Or {#मुखं द्वितीयश्चन्द्रः,#} (her)
face is another moon, would be an {#अतिशयोक्ति#} (q. v.) or
hyperbole in virtue of {#अध्यवसान,#} the comparison as it
were resting on its own merit. E. {#सो#} with {#अव#} and {#अधि,#}
kṛt aff. {#ल्युट्#}.
