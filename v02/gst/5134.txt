{#अपालङ्क#}¦ Tatpur. (?) m. ({#-ङ्कः#}) A plant (Cassia fistula).--
The word is udātta on the last syllable. E.? (The {%Sid-%}
{%dhāntakaum.%} in its chapter, the {#फिट्सूत्र,#} gives the word
only in its crude form, whence the masc. gender could not
be established; in the E. I. H. Ms. No. 98 of these Sūtras
the comm. writes once {#अपालङ्का#} and another time {#अपालङ्कः,#}
the latter being probably the correct form, to judge from the
synonymes and the form {#पालङ्क#} which seems kindred to it.)
