{#अन्वाहार्य#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. ({#-र्यः#}) Rice which is given as a
present to the priests upon certain sacrificial occasions, as
at the performance of the Darśapūrṇamāsa; (presents there-
fore of a garment or of a calf are not an {#अन्वाहार्य;#}) the
sacrificial acts must be, moreover, such as are connected
with the ritual of the Yajurveda ({#‘अन्वाहार्यदक्षिणाध्वर्यु-#}
{#वेदे’#}). Comp. {#अन्वाहार्यपचन#}.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-र्यम्#}) The monthly Śrāddha or funeral repast in
honour of the Manes, held on the day of the new moon;
it should consist of meat of an excellent quality and is so
called, because it is partaken after the presentation of a
piṇḍa to the Manes (comp. {#पिण्डान्वाहार्यक#}); according to
this definition of Manu, it would be the same as the {#पार्वण#}
q. v.--others, as quoted by Bharatamalla on the Amarak.
s. v., define it as the monthly Śrāddha at the end of the
year, when the presentation of the piṇḍa has not taken
place ({#‘अकृतसपिण्डीकरणस्य वत्सरान्ते प्रतिमासं यच्छ्राद्धं#}
{#तत्रान्वाहार्यमिति केचित्’#}). According to the Gṛhyasūtra
of Gobhila (as quoted by Rādhākāntadeva) it would be
<sup>a.</sup> the Śrāddha which is the preparatory act to any religious
ceremony, <sup>b.</sup> the second Śrāddha performed on the day of
the new moon, and <sup>c.</sup> the same as {#अन्वाहार्य#} {%m.,%} but in the
more general sense of a present given at the end of any
sacrificial act: {#‘यच्छ्राद्धं कर्मणामादौ या चान्ते दक्षिणा भ-#}
{#वेत् । अमावास्यं द्वितीयं यदन्वाहार्यं विदुर्बुधाः । इति गो-#}
{#भिलगृह्यम्’#}.--See also {#अनुहार्य#} and the following. E. {#अनु#}
and {#आहार्य,#} 1. scil. {#ओदन,#} 2. scil. {#श्राद्ध#}.
