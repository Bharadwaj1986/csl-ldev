[{#अन्नाकालभृत#}.¦ A misreading for {#अनाकालभृत#} q. v. As the
reading {#अन्नाकालभृत#} occurs in the present edition of the
Vivādachintāmaṇi while the reading {#अनाकालभृत#} is given
in one E. I. H. Ms. of it, in both actual editions of the Mi-
tākṣara and in the E. I. H. Mss. of this work in the same
sense, it may be as well to observe that the meaning in-
tended by the former part of the compound could not be ex-
pressed by the word {#अन्नाकाल#} but, if {#अन्न#} were to make part
of it, would require a form {#अनन्नकाल; अनाकाल,#} however,
similar in structure to {#अनावृष्टि,#} is a correct formation im-
plying ‘hard time in general i. e. time of distress, famine &c.’.]
