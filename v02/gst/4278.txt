{#अन्यपूर्वा#}¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-वा#}) A woman who has been given to,
or has had intercourse with, another man than the one to
whom she is married; this may be the case if she is either
a {#पुनर्भू#} or a {#स्वैरिणी;#} as a {#पुनर्भू#} (q. v.) again, she had either
ceased to be a virgin before the nuptial ceremonies, or she
had remained a virgin and become blemished through the
repeated celebration of the marriage ceremonies; she is
{#स्वैरिणी#} or licentious, if she leaves her husband and goes,
out of lust, to a man of the same caste. A woman, how-
ever, is not considered to be a {#पुनर्भू,#} if she is left without
a son and, by order of her Guru, is approached, for the
sake of getting a son, by her brother-in-law, or a relative
of the class of the Sapiṇḍas or a man of the same Gotra,
either of them having been previously anointed with clari-
fied butter. (According to the Mitākṣara as founded on
Yājnavalkya; Manu applies the term {#परपूर्वा,#} the same as
{#अन्यपूर्वा,#} only to the licentious woman who leaves her hus-
band for another man; Nārada uses the synonymous term
{#परपूर्वा#} in a similar manner as the Mitākṣara {#अन्यपूर्वा,#} but
divides the {#पुनर्भू#} into three and the {#स्वैरिणी#} into four cate-
gories; for according to him a {#पुनर्भू#} may be either a virgin-
woman who is blemished by having gone through the mar-
riage ceremonies for a second time, or a woman who first
has been given to one and then on account of her love, to
another, or a woman who, in want of a brother-in-law,
is given by her relations to a Sapiṇḍa-relative of the same
caste; a {#स्वैरिणी#} a woman, whether having had children or
[Page145-a+ 56]
not, who, while her husband is alive, goes to another from
lust, or a woman who leaves her infant husband for another
man and later returns to the house of her husband; or a
woman who after the death of her husband slights her brother-
in-law and the other relations (she may approach) and goes
from lust to another man, or lastly, a woman who has come
from the country and, purchased with money, under the
pressure of hunger and thirst gives herself up to another
man. E. {#अन्य#} and {#पूर्व;#} scil. {#स्त्री#}.
