{#अभिवादन#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) Respectful salutation of a superior
or elder, especially of a Guru, by a junior or inferior for the
sake of obtaining his blessing; ({%Vīramitr. Āchāraprak.:%} {#अ-#}
{#भिवादननाम वटोरात्मानमभि गुरोराशीर्वचनानुकूलो व्यापा-#}
{#रः#}). It consists of three acts, viz. 1. the {#प्रत्युत्थान#} or rising
from the seat, 2. the {#उपसंग्रहण#} or {#पादोपसंग्रहण,#} the peculiar
[Page264-b+ 56]
mode of Hindu obeisance, and 3. the {#अभिवाद#} or the ut-
tering of the formula of salutation.
<div n="P"><sup>a.</sup> The first act is indispensable on the part of the person
whose duty it is to make the salutation, whatever be the
quality of the person saluted ({%Āpastamba:%} {#सर्वत्र तु प्रत्युत्था-#}
{#याभिवादनम्#}); but the two other acts undergo various
modifications according to the rank or quality of the person
saluted and the person saluting.
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> With regard to the {#उपसंग्रहण#} or the obeisance, the
general rule is, according to {%Manu,%} that the saluter should
with crossed hands ({%comm.:%} the right hand being placed
over the left) clasp the feet of his {%Guru,%} touching the left
foot with his left, and the right foot with his right, hand;
({%Manu:%} {#व्यस्तपाणिना कार्यमुपसंग्रहणं गुरोः । सव्येन सव्यः#}
{#स्प्रष्टव्यो दक्षिणेन च दक्षिणः#}); the same injunction is given
by {%Āśvalāyana%} and {%Baudhāyana%} with the addition that he
should first touch, with composure of mind, his own left
ear with his left and his right ear with his right, hand,
and then make his bow, in the indicated manner, by
touching his Guru from the knees to the feet; ({%Āśvalāy.:%}
{#वामं वामेन संस्पृश्य दक्षिणेन तु दक्षिणम् । हस्तेन कर्णं हस्ताभ्यां#}
{#गुरूणामभिवादनम् । वामोपरि करं कृत्वा दक्षिणं नाम चो-#}
{#च्चरेत् । जानुप्रभृति पादान्तमारभ्य पादयोर्नमेत्;#} {%Baudhāy.:%}
{#श्रोत्रे संस्पृश्य मनः समाधायाधस्ताज्जान्वोरा पद्भ्यामित्युपसंग्र-#}
{#हणम्#}); according to some, his hands must be made
hollow, when he touches the feet of the Guru and he
is forbidden, under the threat of loosing the benefit of all
his pious actions, to perform this act only with one hand
({%Paīṭhīnasi:%} {#उत्तानाभ्यां पाणिभ्यां दक्षिणेन दक्षिणं सव्येन सव्यं#}
{#पादमभिवादयेत्;#} {%Viṣṇu:%} {#अजाकर्णेन विदुषां मूर्खाणामेकपा-#}
{#णिना;#} {%Vīramitr.%} on the latter: {#श्रोत्रसमौ करौ कृत्वा पुनर-#}
{#जाकर्णवत्संपुटितेन करद्वयेनेत्यर्थः;#} {%Viṣṇu:%} {#जन्मप्रभृति यत्किं-#}
{#चिच्चेतसा धर्ममाचरेत् । सर्वं तन्निष्फलं याति एकहस्ताभिवा-#}
{#दनात्#}); {%Āpastamba%} enjoins, on his part, that a Brāhmaṇa
when saluting should raise his right arm as far as his ears,
a Kshatriya as far as his breast (or according to a v. 1. as
far as his shoulder), a Vaiśya as far as his navel and that
a Sūdra making his obeisance should hold it down ({%Āpast.:%}
{#स्वं दक्षिणं बाहुं श्रोत्रसमं प्रसार्य ब्राह्मणोऽभिवादयेतोरःसमं#}
{#राजन्यो मध्यसमं वैश्यो नीचैः शूद्रः प्राञ्जलिः;#} {%Vīram.%} on the
latter: {#अंससमं राजन्य इत्यपि पाठः । मध्यं नाभिः;#} {%Atri,%} how-
ever, seems to reserve this mode of salutation for a learned
Brāhmaṇa in general, while he enjoins the touching of the
feet, if the person saluted is a Guru; {#दक्षिणं पाणिमुद्धृत्य#}
{#प्रकाममभिवादयेत् । श्रोत्रिये त्वञ्जलिः कार्यः पादोपग्रहणं गु-#}
{#रोरिति#}). If the person to be saluted is a woman, the
politeness of touching her from the knees to the feet is sub-
ject to some restrictions: if she is the wife of the {%Guru,%}
but not of the same class as her husband, {%Manu%} and other
legislators dispense with it altogether; if she is of the same
class and the student is young, he must pay her that re-
spect only when he returns from a journey, on other oc-
casions he prostrates himself before her at his daily salu-
tation, ({%Vīram.%} on {%Manu%} 2. 217. and {%Gautama:%} {#विप्रोष्येति व-#}
{#चनान्न प्रत्यहमिति गम्यते#}); but if she is young and the young
man knows already to distinguish right from wrong which
[Page265-a+ 56]
is the case when he has completed his twentieth year (ac-
cording to {%Manu;%} or his sixteenth year, according to the
{%Vīram.%} on {%Gautama%}) he must never touch her feet but al-
ways prostrate himself before her; {%Manu%} enjoins further
that the sister of his mother, the wife of his maternal
uncle, his own wife's mother and the sister of his father
must be treated by him like the wife of his Guru, equally
so the wife of his brother ({%comm.:%} the eldest wife, of the
same class), and that the sister of his father and of his
mother as well as his own elder sister must be saluted in
the same manner as his mother, but that his paternal and
maternal kinswomen are to be greeted by touching their
feet only on his return from a journey. {%Gautama'%}s rule
that the wives of a brother and one's own wife's mother
are never to be touched in this manner is restricted by the
{%Vīramitrodaya%} to the wives of the same class ({%Gaut.:%} {#नोप-#}
{#संग्रहणं भ्रातृभार्याणां श्वश्र्वाश्च;#} {%Viram.:%} {#यन्नोप°° इति गौत-#}
{#मवाक्यं तदसवर्णाविषयम्#}), and when the same legislator
enjoins that with the exception of a mother, the wife of a
paternal uncle and a sister, no woman must be touched
by her feet in being greeted except on the return from a
journey, the same commentator infers that this ceremony
is obligatory on the latter occasion ({%Gautama:%} {#नाविप्रोष्य#}
{#स्त्रीणाममातृपितृव्यभार्याभागिनीनाम्;#} {%Vīram.:%} {#अविप्रोष्येति#}
{#वचनाद्विप्रोष्य तु पादोपसंग्रहणं कर्तव्यमेव#}).
<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> The formula of salutation consists in general, if the
person greeted is a man, of the word {#अभिवादये#} ‘I greet’,
followed by the declaration of the saluter's own name and
ending with the reverential word {#भोः#} ({%Manu:%} {#अभिवादात्परं#}
{#विप्रो ज्यायांसमभिवादयन् । असौ नामाहमस्मीति स्वं नाम#}
{#परिकीर्तयेत् ।…भोःशब्दं कीर्तयेदन्ते स्वस्य नाम्नोऽभि-#}
{#वादने । नाम्नां स्वरूपभावो हि भोभाव ऋषिभिः स्मृतः#}); e. g.
{#अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं भोः,#} or {#अभिवादय इन्द्रवर्माहं भोः,#}
or {#अभिवादय इन्द्रपालितोऽहं भोः,#} or (if a woman greets) e. g.
{#अभिवादये गार्ग्यहं भोः;#} according to the {%Vīram.,%} some com-
bine with the declaration of the name also that of the family
and the descendants when the word {#अभिवादये#} is placed
at the end of the salutation, e. g. {#अमुकप्रवरोऽमुकगोत्रोऽमुक-#}
{#शर्माहं भो भिवादये#} ‘father of such and such a son, descendant
of such and such a family, I, such and such a…sarman,
(e. g. {#कृष्णशर्मन्#}) Sir, greet (thee)’; if husband and wife salute
there is no other restriction ({%Gaut.:%} {#स्त्रीपुंयोगेऽभिवादतो#}
{#ऽनियममेके#}), but the formula becomes shortened in this way:
{#अभिवादये गार्ग्यहं गार्गशर्माहं भोः#}. If the person saluted is a
woman or a Śūdra or a man who either does not understand
the Sanskṛt meaning of the proper name or does not know
the proper manner of protracting the final vowel of the
name in the return of the salutation or is otherwise igno-
rant of the proper manner of returning it (see g.), the formula
of the saluter is simply thus: {#‘अभिवादयेऽहम्’#} ‘I greet’,
such an address being not considered an {#अभिवादन;#} ({%Vī-%}
{%ram.%} on {%Manu.%} 2. 123. and 126.: {#नामधेयस्याभिवादनिकस्या-#}
{#भिवादमभिवादनवाक्यार्थत्वं ये न जानते तान्स्त्रीं च प्रत्यह-#}
{#मिति लौकिकं नाम चोच्चरेत्प्राज्ञो न पूर्वोक्तमभिवादनवाक्यम् ।#}
{#यद्वा नामधेयस्याभिवादकनाम्नोऽन्तेऽभिवादं प्लुताकारारिकं#}
{#न जानते तान्प्रतीति द्वेधा मेधातिथिर्व्याचख्यौ;#} {%Medhātithi%} re-
[Page265-b+ 56]
ferring to the Śūtra and Vārttikas of {%Pāṇini%} VIII. 2. 83.).
[{%Medhātithi%} and {%Govindarāja%} take the word {#नाम#} in the
passage of Manu quoted above in its literal sense and give
the formula; e. g. {%Medhāt.:%} {#अभिवादये देवदत्तनामाहं भोः,#}
but this mode of salutation is not approved of by other
authorities; e. g. {%Kullūka%} in reference to this use of {#नामन्:#}
{#मेधातिथिगोविन्दराजयोरभिधानमप्रमाणम्#}.]
<div n="P"><sup>d.</sup> The general rule that prevails at a salutation is that
the person who receives it must be an ‘elder’ or what is
technically termed a {%Guru%} and that the person who pays
it must be a ‘youth’ or an inferior; such a salutation
may be of course occasional, but it is a duty of a youth
to salute his ‘elders’ or ‘Gurus’ every morning after
he has managed the consecrated fire ({%Yājnav.:%} {#अग्निकार्यं#}
{#ततः कुर्यात्संध्ययोरुभयोरपि ॥ ततोऽभिवादयेद्वृद्धानसावहमि-#}
{#ति ब्रुवन्;#} {%Yama:%} {#ततोऽभिवादयेद्वृद्धानग्निकार्यादनन्तरम्;#}
{%Gautama:%} {#गुरोः पादोपसंग्रहणं प्रातः#}).--For the persons
comprised under the name {#गुरु#} and their relative superiority
or inferiority see s. v., it may suffice here to give the de-
finition of {%Devala%} who enumerates as male Gurus: the
teacher (see {#उपाध्याय#}), the father, the eldest brother, the
king, the maternal and paternal uncle, the father-in-law,
an initiated householder, the maternal and paternal grand-
father, and the eldest of the same class; as female Gurus:
the mother, the maternal and paternal grandmother, the
sisters of father and mother, the mother-in-law, and the
old nurse; and to add from the definition of others the
priest (see {#ऋत्विज्#}) and the spiritual teacher (see {#आचार्य#}).
If there are several persons present who have a claim to a
salutation, the teacher who has given instruction either on
worldly or ritual or spiritual matters, has precedence be-
fore all others, according to {%Manu%} ({#लौकिकं वैदिकं चापि#}
{#तथाध्यात्मिकमेव च । आददीत यतो ज्ञानं तं पूर्वमभिवादयेत्#}),
and, in general, every superior Guru has precedence before
the one next to him in degree. [In the passage of {%Gautama:%}
{#पादोपसंग्रहणं गुरुसमवायेऽन्वहम् । अभिगम्य तु विप्रोष्य मा-#}
{#तृपितृतद्बन्धूनां#} (i. e. mother, father, maternal uncle and aunt,
paternal uncle and aunt &c.) {#पूर्वजानां#} (i. e. elder brothers
&c.) {#विद्यागुरूणां#} (i. e. the Upādhyāya, Āchārya &c.) {#तत्त-#}
{#द्गुरूणां च#} (i. e. their maternal or paternal grandfathers &c.)
{#संनिपाते परस्य,#} the last word ({#परस्य#}) does not imply that
each {%following%} precedes in rank each preceding, but means
each {%superior; Vīram.:%} {#मात्रादीनां पुरा यत्संनिपाते समागमे#}
{#परस्योत्कृष्टस्य प्रथममुपसंग्रहणं कर्तव्यम्#}.] The term ‘youth’
mentioned above is not to be taken in its literal, but in its
metaphorical sense; for {%Manu%} rules that fellow citizens are
equal (as to age) for ten years, dancers and singers for five,
learned theologians for three, but persons related by blood
for a very short time; again, that one must consider a
Brāhmaṇa though but ten years old, as if he were the father
of a Kshatriya though aged a hundred years; therefore a
friend, e. g., is not to be addressed with the words {#भोः#} or
{#भवत्,#} unless he be older than ten years, and a Brāhmaṇa
must never salute first a Kshatriya or a man of a lower
class, however distinguished he be ({%Vīram.:%} {#दशवर्षाधिककः#}
{#सखा भोभवच्छब्दाभ्यां संबोध्यः;#} {%Śātātapa:%} {#नाभिवाद्यास्तु वि-#}
[Page266-a+ 56]
{#प्रेण क्षत्रियाद्याः कथंचन । ज्ञानकर्मगुणोपेता यद्यप्येते बहुश्रु-#}
{#ताः#}); for if he does so, he incurs severe spiritual penalties.
<div n="P"><sup>e.</sup> Persons not to be saluted are, according to {%Manu, Gau-%}
{%tama, Baudhāyana:%} a priest ({%Ṛtvij%}), a wife's father, a maternal
and paternal uncle, learned and pious persons, {%if they are%}
{%younger;%} they are merely to be addressed with the words ‘I, so
and so, am here’ {#असावहम्,#} and to be honoured by rising from
the seat; this ceremony does not constitute, therefore, an
{#अभिवादन#}. [In {%Manu%} 2. 130. the word {#गुरून्#} is to be taken
in the sense of ‘an elder by learning and piousness’; it
does not occur in the corresponding passages of {%Gautama%}
and {%Baudh.;%} the former: {#ऋत्विक्श्वशुरपितृव्यमातुलानां तु य-#}
{#वीयसां प्रत्युत्थानमनभिवाद्याः;#} the latter with the same words
except for the last, {#प्रत्युत्थायाभिभाषणम्#}.] In law courts, in
houses of penance and palaces where Brāhmaṇas are assem-
bled, the latter are not to be saluted individually, but the words
{#सर्वेभ्यो नमः#} ‘respect to all’ are to be addressed to the whole
assembly; this mode of address is called the {#नमस्कार#} which
is different therefore from the {#अभिवादन;#} ({%Viṣṇu:%} {#सभासु#}
{#चैव सर्वासु यज्ञराजगृहेषु च नमस्कारं न कुर्वीत ब्राह्मणं ना-#}
{#भिवादयेत्;#} {%Vīram.%} on those words: {#सर्वासु धर्मव्यवहारप्रा-#}
{#यश्चित्तादिनिर्णयसभासु नमस्कारं न कुर्यात् । प्रत्येकमिति शे-#}
{#षः । किं तु सर्वेभ्यो नम इत्येव वक्तव्यम्;#} {%Vṛhadviṣṇu:%} {#सभां#}
{#नाभिवादयेत्#}); {%Āpastamba%} forbids to salute a man who
carries fuel, flowers, kuśa grass, fire, water and rice in
his hands and one who performs the Japahoma; {%Kātyāyana:%}
a wicked man, a cripple, a stranger, one who has enemies
after him, a diseased person, a Yogin, one bent upon do-
ing penance and a youngster (similarly {%Vṛhaspati%}); {%Śatā-%}
{%tapa:%} a heretic, an outcaste ({#पतित#}), a Vrātya (q. v.), a
person while his head is oiled, while eating, yawning,
cleansing his teeth, performing his natural functions &c.;
the {%Vṛhadnāradīya:%} an atheist, a libertine ({#भिन्नमर्याद#}), an
impious man, a thief and a cheat, a man fond of litigation,
a drunken man, one who vomits or stands in water, one
who carries rice given to him as alms or one who is in a
lying position, one who performs a Śrāddha, a vow or a
sacrifice; amongst {%women Śātātapa%} forbids to greet: one in
her courses, one recently delivered, one who has killed her
husband and one who has miscarried.
<div n="P"><sup>f.</sup> A man must not salute, according to {%Āpastamba,%} while
he has his shoes on, while his head is covered ({#वेष्टितशि-#}
{#राः#}) and while his hands are stretched out; according to
{%Śaṅkha,%} while he carries water in his hands, while he is
unclean, performs funeral rites or is in a lying position
…, according to {%Baudhāyana,%} while he carries fuel, a
water-jug, flowers or rice.
<div n="P"><sup>g.</sup> The return of the salutation or the {#प्रत्यभिवादन#} con-
sists, generally, in uttering first the words {#आयुष्मान्भव#}
{#सौम्य#} ‘long mayst thou live, friend’ or similar words to
the same effect; ({%Manu:%} {#आयुष्मान्भव सौम्येति वाच्यो विप्रो#}
{#ऽभिवादने,#} where the word {#इति#} indicates, according to {%Me-%}
{%dhātithi%} and the {%Vīramitrodaya,%} that the preceding words are
merely an illustration of the phrase to be used; thus the
address may be worded also in this manner: {#आयुष्मानेधि#} or
{#दीर्घायुर्भूयाः#} or {#चिरं जीव#} &c.); these words are followed
[Page266-b+ 56]
by the name of the person who has greeted first and, if
the latter is a Brāhmaṇa, the last vowel of his name, which
at the same time is the last vowel of the whole phrase, be-
comes protracted (according to the general rules on making
vowels {#प्लुत#} q. v.); some require moreover, that the name
should always receive the addition of the word {#शर्मन्,#} others,
however, consider this addition unnecessary ({%Manu:%} {#अका-#}
{#रश्चास्य नाम्नोऽन्ते वाच्यः पूर्वाक्षरः प्लुतः;#} {%Vīram.:%} {#तत्र नामै-#}
{#वेति केचित् । शर्मान्तमित्यपरे#}); the return of the salute to
a Brāhmaṇa would therefore run on the following pattern:
{#आयुष्मान्भव सौम्य देवदत्ता३,#} or {#आयुष्मान्भव सौम्य देवद-#}
{#त्तशर्मा ३ न्,#} or {#आयुष्मान्भव पिणाकपाणा ३ इ (= पिणाक-#}
{#पाणे),#} or {#…विष्णा ३ उ (= विष्णो),#} or {#आयुष्मानेधि#}
{#…#} &c.; (the omission of the word {#शर्मन्#} when it originally
belongs to the name, or the omission of the name altogether
are rebuked by {%Kullūka%}). If the person thus addressed is
a Kshatriya or Vaiśya or if the word {#भोः#} is added after
the name (which seems permitted according to {%Kātyāyana%}
on {%Pāṇ.%} VIII. 2. 83., although {%Patanjali%} observes that other
authorities do not approve of the combination of the name
{%and%} {#भोः,#} but allow only the enunciation of the one or the
other), the protraction of the vowel is optional; e. g. in
returning the salute to a Kshatriya: {#आयुष्मानेधीन्द्रवर्मा ३ न्#}
or {#…°वर्मन्,#} to a Vaiśya: {#आयुष्मानेधीन्द्रपालिता ३#} or
{#…°पालित;#} or with {#भोः, आयुष्मानेधि देवदत्त भोः ३#} or
{#…भोः#} (but the latter phrase should be, according to the
above mentioned observation, either {#आयुष्मानेधि भोः ३#} or
{#…देवदत्ता ३#}); if the person addressed is a woman or a
Śūdra or spoken to in contempt or derision, no protraction
of the vowel takes place, e. g. a woman: {#आयुष्मती भव#}
{#गार्गि;#} a Śūdra: {#आयुष्मानेधि तुषजक;#} or in contempt: {#आ-#}
{#युष्मानेधि स्थालिन्#} ({%Patanjali:%} {#असूयकस्त्वमसि जाल्म । न त्वं#}
{#प्रत्यभिवादनमर्हसि । भिद्यस्व वृषल स्थालिन्;#} {%Kaiyyaṭa:%} {#असू-#}
{#यकः प्रत्याचष्टे । प्रत्यभिवादवाक्यान्तस्थस्य नाम्नो गोत्रस्य च#}

{#पहासार्थमसूयकस्तमाक्षिपति तदासौ प्रत्यभिवादं नार्हत्याशी-#}
{#र्वचनं हि प्रत्यभिवादो गृह्यते । प्रतिसंभाषणमात्रं तु प्रत्यभिवादं#}
{#मत्वा वार्त्तिककृतासूयके प्रतिषेध उक्तः;#} in phrases such as
{#देवदत्त कुशल्यसि, देवदत्त आयुष्मानेधि#} which are not word-
ed in the proper manner in which the return of a salutation
should be made, since the name does not stand at the end
of the sentence, the protraction of the vowel is equally
prohibited).--If the person to whom the salutation is to
be returned, has performed the preparatory observances of
a sacrifice, his name should not be enounced but in its
place the reverential word {#भोः;#} and to the wife of another
or to any woman not related by blood the epithet of address
should be {#भवति#} or {#सुभगे#} or {#भगिनि#} (according to {%Manu%}).
After the person has returned the greeting, he may put
the usual polite questions, after the saluter's health &c.;
(it is not therefore the latter who asks after the health &c.
of the person who returns the salute, for {%Govindarāja%} who
expresses that opinion, is rebuked for it by {%Kullūka%}); the
model, however, laid down by {%Manu%} and {%Āpastamba,%} that
a Brāhmaṇa must be asked whether he prospers, a Ksha-
[Page267-a+ 56]
triya whether he is quite well, a Vaiśya whether he is
happy, and a Śūdra whether he is free from disease ({%Manu:%}
{#ब्राह्मणं कुशलं पृच्छेत्क्षत्रबन्धुमनामयम् । वैश्यं क्षेमं समागम्य#}
{#शूद्रमारोग्यमेव च;#} {%Āpastamba:%} {#कुशलमवरवयसं समानवयसं#}
{#वा विप्रं पृच्छेत् । अनामयं क्षत्रियं क्षेमं वैश्यमारोग्यं शूद्रम्#})
is not to be taken in its literal sense, as the commentators
observe and as may be inferred from instances in the epic
and dramatic literature; thus in the {%Sabhāparvan%} of the {%Ma-%}
{%hābhārata, Nārada%} after having returned the salute of {%Yu-%}
{%dhishthira%} does not content himself with the question whether
the king is quite well, but overwhelms him with an inter-
rogatory of 110 Slokas (v. 151-260) which is perhaps the
completest of its kind, though probably an overdone illus-
tration of this part of a Hindu greeting.
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> The object of the {#प्रत्यभिवादन#} being a blessing ({%Viṣṇu:%}
{#शिष्याणामाशिषं दद्यात्पादोपग्रहणो गुरुः#} and compare the
commencement of this article), a person who omits to re-
turn the salutation is threatened by {%Yama%} to become guilty
of all the sins of the person he ought to have greeted
({#अभिवादे तु यः पूर्वमाशिषं न प्रयच्छति । यद्दुष्कृतं भवेत्तस्य#}
{#तस्माद्भागं प्रपद्यते#}), by {%Angiras%} to fall into hell and by
the {%Bhavishya-Purāṇa%} moreover, if the person thus slighted
is a Brāhmaṇa, to be reborn in a future life as a tree on a
cemetery which will be inhabited by vultures and crows;
