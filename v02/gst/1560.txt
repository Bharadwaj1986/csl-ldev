{#अथर्वन्#}¦ 1. m. ({#-र्वा#}) <sup>1</sup> A Brāhmaṇa, a priest (probably one
connected with offerings to fire or the attendance on the
holy fire). <sup>2</sup> The proper name of a priest who is considered
to have obtained the fire from heaven and who in the course
of mythological personification appears as a Prajāpati or
father of all beings, as the inspired author of the fourth
or Atharvaveda, as the eldest son of Brahmā to whom
Brahmā revealed the Brahmavidyā (q. v.) or knowledge of
God (see also {#अथर्व#}) and, at a later period, as the same
as Angiras (q. v.). Sons of his are Agni (see also {#अङ्गिरस्#}),
Dadhyanch, Bhishaj, Bṛhaddiva, Kabandha. <sup>3</sup> An epithet of
<sup>a.</sup> Vasiṣṭha q. v., <sup>b.</sup> Soma q. v., <sup>c.</sup> {#प्राण#} q. v., <sup>d.</sup> Śiva (the god being
supposed to carry into effect the charms of the Atharvaveda).
<div n="P">2. m. n. ({#-र्वा-र्व#}) The fourth or Atharvaveda q. v. (see
also m. pl. {#अथर्वाणः#}).
<div n="P">3. m. pl. ({#-र्वाणः#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of Atharvan; they
appear sometimes coupled with the descendants of Bhṛgu
and of Angiras (see {#अथर्वाङ्गिरसः#}). <sup>2</sup> The hymns of the
fourth or Atharvaveda collectively (considered as the descen-
dants of Atharvan); the Atharvaveda (see also {#अथर्वाङ्गि-#}
{#रसः#}). E. From an obsolete theme {#अथर्,#} fire, with taddh.
aff. {#वनिप्#}. See the E. of {#अथरी#}. The oldest etym. which
derives {#अथर्वन्#} from {#अ#} neg. and {#थर्वन्#} (from {#थर्व्#} ‘to go’),
is without any probability. A similar etym. is given of
{#अथर्वी#} q. v.
