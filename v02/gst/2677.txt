{#अनित्यसम#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-मः-मा#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
<div n="lb">Wrongly generalizing the predicament of perishableness i. e.
<div n="lb">a sophism on perishableness; viz. arguing perishableness
<div n="lb">from the reason that every thing is perishable because it
<div n="lb">shares in some qualities with other things which are pe-
<div n="lb">rishable. E. {#अनित्य#} and {#सम#} (in the sense of {#जाति,#} sophism);
<div n="lb">the masc. form of this word is explained according to some,
<div n="lb">by the ellipsis of {#प्रतिषेध#} or contradiction, as a Sūtra in
<div n="lb">the Nyāya treating on a sophism is always followed by
<div n="lb">another containing the refutation; or, according to others,
<div n="lb">by the ellipsis of {#विकल्प#} (in the sense of {#विविधः कल्पः#}
<div n="lb">i. e. {#प्रकारः#} or variousness), there being various sophisms,
<div n="lb">viz. twenty-four; or according to others, by the ellipsis of
<div n="lb">{#प्रयोग#} i. e. a (logical) proceeding which likens or produces
<div n="lb">the plausibility of perishableness; or the word is taken as
<div n="lb">a Bahuvr. with the ellipsis of {#प्रयोग#} i. e. a logical proceeding
<div n="lb">in which perishableness is likened (viz. made plausible).--
<div n="lb">As a feminine, {#°समा#} is taken in the sense of {#जाति,#} sophism.
