{#अनग्निष्वात्त#}¦ Tatpur. m. pl. ({#-त्ताः#}) The name of a particular
<div n="lb">class of Pitṛs or Manes. This word is explained by a
<div n="lb">commentator of the Yajurveda: ‘not tasted by ({#स्वात्त#}) i. e.
<div n="lb">not burnt by fire, not having received the obsequies in con-
<div n="lb">formity with the religious rites’ and it appears therefore as
<div n="lb">a synonyme of {#अनग्निदग्ध,#} as well as the converse of {#अग्नि-#}
<div n="lb">{#ष्वात्त#} which, according to the same commentator, would
<div n="lb">be a synonyme of {#अग्निदग्ध#}. Anagniṣvātta does not occur
<div n="lb">in the list of the Pitṛs which are given in the law books
<div n="lb">and in the Purāṇas, while {#अग्निदग्ध#} and {#अग्निष्वात्त#} (qq. vv.)
<div n="lb">are named there as distinct classes and explained in a
<div n="lb">different manner. The etymology given, which identifies
<div n="lb">{#स्वात्त#} and {#स्वादित,#} seems moreover objectionable. E. {#अ#}
<div n="lb">and {#अग्निष्वात्त#}.
