{#अनुदात्त#}¦ Tatpur. (In Grammar.) 1. m. f. n. ({#-त्तः-त्ता-त्तम्#})
Not elevated, not being pronounced with the accent called
{#उदात्त#} (q. v.) or {#स्वरित#} (q. v.) (as the syllable of a word).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-त्तः#}) The not elevated accent, the accent (see
{#स्वर#} and {#वाह्यप्रयत्न#}) which is neither {#उदात्त#} (q. v.) nor
{#स्वरित#} (q. v.) and which by the depression of the voice, it
requires, prepares, as it were, for the greater effort in the
pronunciation of the syllables accented with the {#उदात्त#} or
{#स्वरित#}. This depression being the greatest when the syl-
lable having the {#अनुदात्त#} accent, is immediately followed
by a syllable accented with the {#उदात्त#} or {#स्वरित,#} the {#अनु-#}
{#दात्त#} is called in this case {#अनुदात्ततर#} ‘a very anudātta’.
The mode of marking the {#अनुदात्त,#} is restricted, as is also
the case with the other two accents, to the vaidik Sanhitās
(Sanhitā-Pāṭhas) and Brāhmaṇas, and varies according to
the different Vedas. In the Sanhitā, Pada and the Brāhmaṇas
of the Ṛgveda, in the Sanhitā and Pada of the Yajur- and
Sanhitā of the Atharvaveda the Anudātta is marked with a
horizontal line under the syllable so accented ({%thus becoming%}
{%comparable also in graphic value to the sign of the Virāma, the%}
{%horizontal line representing as it were the repose in accentua-%}
{%tion%}); in the Brāhmaṇas of the White Yajurveda, it is not
marked at all; and in the Sanhitā of the Sāmaveda the anu-
dātta syllable when anudāttatara before an udātta, or before
a svarita syllable bearing the figures {#२#} or {#३,#} is marked with
the figure {#३#} over it, except when it is preceded in the be-
ginning of a verse by other anudātta syllables, in which
case only the first anudātta syllable bears the figure {#३,#}
while the following anudātta syllables are left unmarked.
If the anudāttatara is followed by a svarita syllable bearing
the sign {#२र,#} the syllable so accented is marked with {#३क#}.
In the Pada-text of the Sāmaveda the sign {#३#} denotes the
anudāttatara before an udātta, if the latter occupies the
second syllable from the beginning, or the syllable before
an anudāttatara, if the latter is followed by a svarita, or
lastly the anudātta accentuation of a syllable so marked and
of all the syllables following it until an udātta or svarita
syllable comes; the sign {#३क#} or {#क#} denotes the anudāttatara
immediately followed by a svarita. Compare also the terms
{#नीच, निहत, न्यस्त, न्यस्ततर, नियत, निघात, न्यास, नियम#}
and the radd. {#हन्#} with {#नि#} and {#यम्#} with {#नि#}.--In the native
[Page090-b+ 56]
lists of radicals, the Dhātupāthas, certain radicals have the
anudātta accent as an {#इत्#} (q. v.) or {#अनुबन्ध#} (q. v.) connected
with them i. e. as a technical sign for certain rules they are
subject to with respect to derivation &c. See also {#अनु-#}
{#दात्तेत्#} and {#अनुदात्तोपदेश#}. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#अनुदात्त#}.
