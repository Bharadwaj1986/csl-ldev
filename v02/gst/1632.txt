the Maruts and Agni, but it becomes personified especially in

cow, <sup>3</sup> speech; but especially <sup>4</sup> Aditi, the first goddess of
the intermediate space or air, the mother of the Gods, who
at a later period was considered as the daughter of Daksha
and wife of Kaśyapa, as the sister of Agastya and as the
mother of the twelve Ādityas, of the eight Vasus, eleven
Rudras and two Aśvins, besides of the thirty-six Tushitas.
--Aditi is in a still later time also an appellative of Durgā.
