{#अदक्षिण#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-णः-णा-णम्#}) I. Tatpur. <sup>1</sup> Not right, left.
<sup>2</sup> Not clever, unskilful. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#दक्षिण#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. Being or being performed without the presents
usually given to Brahmans (see {#दक्षिणा#}), as a sacrifice &c.
The celebration of a sacrifice without the Dakṣiṇā oc-
curs for instance under the following circumstances: at
the Prātaḥsavana of the Jyotiṣṭoma, when about to sing
the Vahiṣpavamāna stotra, the priests step out from the
house where the sacred fire is kept, one going after the
other and holding the one who precedes by the hem of his
garment: if it so happens, at this procession, that the
Udgātṛ inadvertently drops the hem, the sacrifice goes on
without the Dakṣiṇā; once accomplished, however, it is
to be repeated and then the Udgātṛ has to pay the Dakṣiṇā
which should have been given at the first performance; if
the Pratihartṛ meets with a similar accident, he has to pay
his whole property at the renewal of the ceremony, which
then is called {#सर्वस्वदक्षिण#}. E. {#अ#} priv. and {#दक्षिणा#}.
