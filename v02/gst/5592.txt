{#अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-सा#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of the
{#अलङ्कार#} q. v. or elegant modes of composition; viz. implied
or indirect expression (literally: conveying--the subject
matter--by what is not the subject matter); more espe-
cially defined as conveying the subject matter, if it is of a
specific nature by means of generalisation, or if it is of a
general kind, by means of specification, or if it is viewed
as a cause, by stating the effect, or if it is viewed as an
effect, by stating the cause, or hinting at the subject matter
by stating what is similar to it, (the latter category being
divided in two varieties which are again split in two other
varieties; while each of the named categories may be,
moreover, threefold, according to whether the expressed
special or general subject, fact, cause or similarity is of a
real or imaginary or mixed nature); an instance of the
second category is the following: {#स्रगियं यदि जीवितापहा#}
{#हृदये किं निहिता न हन्ति माम् । विषमप्यमृतं क्वचिद्भवेदमृतं#}
{#वा विषमीश्वरेच्छया,#} where the {%general%} idea that the will
of God may turn evil into good and good into evil, is
conveyed by the special instance of poison and amṛta. E.
{#अप्रस्तुत#} and {#प्रशंसा#}.
