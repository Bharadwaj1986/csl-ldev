{#अन्यता#}¦ f. ({#-ता#}) The being other, otherness, difference; also
{#अन्यत्व#} q. v.; e. g. {#जातिलक्षणदेशैरन्यतानवच्छेदात्तुल्ययोस्ततः#}
{#प्रतिपत्तिः#} (Difference) is understood through it (viz. through
profound meditation), since it is impossible to remove the
otherness which exists between two (apparently) like objects
either with regard to species or characteristic properties or
space; (as in the case, for instance of various atoms, or
of Īśvara and the Yogin). E. {#अन्य,#} taddh. aff. {#तल्#}.
