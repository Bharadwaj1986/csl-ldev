{#अनुमान#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Inferring, as the cause of {#अनुमिति#}
<div n="lb">or of a conclusion drawn from given premises. According to
<div n="lb">the Sāṅkhya and Yoga-philosophies it is one of the {%three%}
<div n="lb">means (see {#प्रमाण#}) by which true knowledge may be ob-
<div n="lb">tained (see also {#प्रत्यक्ष#} or {#दृष्ट#} and {#आगम#} or {#आप्तवचन#});
<div n="lb">according to the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika phil., one of the
<div n="lb">{%four%} means for this end (see also {#प्रत्यक्ष, उपमान#} and {#शब्द#}).
<div n="lb">Inference may be, according to the definitions of Sāṅkhya
<div n="lb">and Nyāya philosophers, either one by induction ({#पूर्ववत्#})
<div n="lb">e. g. that it will rain because clouds have gathered, or one
<div n="lb">by analogy ({#सामान्यतो दृष्टम्#}), e. g. that moon and stars are
<div n="lb">locomotive because they change their place and that a person
<div n="lb">therefore who changes his place is locomotive; or one by ne-
<div n="lb">cessity ({#शेषवत्#}), e. g. that the ocean will be salt, because a
<div n="lb">drop taken from it, is salt. According to the Vaiśeṣika
<div n="lb">philosophers, inference may be either purely consecutive or
<div n="lb">positive ({#केवलान्वयिन्#}), i. e. when the major term is not
<div n="lb">excluded by any other notion (comp. {#अनुपसंहारिन्#}), e. g.
<div n="lb">all that can be known can be named, because only positive
<div n="lb">(not negative instances) can be alleged to prove the asser-
<div n="lb">tion; or purely exclusive or negative ({#केवलव्यतिरेकिन्#}), i. e.
<div n="lb">when only negative proof can be adduced, e. g. in asserting
<div n="lb">that earth is distinguished from all the other elements, be-
<div n="lb">cause it is possessed of the quality of smell, for the ar-
<div n="lb">gument would be that all that is not distinguished from
<div n="lb">all the other elements, is not possessed of the quality of
[Page098-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">smell; or positive and negative ({#अन्वयव्यतिरेकिन्#}), i. e.
<div n="lb">when there exist positive and negative instances of the major
<div n="lb">term, e. g. where there is fire there is smoke, because the
<div n="lb">positive argument would be ‘on the hearth’ and the negative
<div n="lb">‘in the lake’. (The Mīmānsā and Vedānta philosophies do
<div n="lb">not discuss these topics, as inference is not considered by
<div n="lb">them to be a means of arriving at true knowledge.) <sup>2</sup> (In
<div n="lb">rhetoric.) A logical anakolouthon by the way of inference,
<div n="lb">an {#अलंकार#} or mode of writing elegantly, e. g. ‘wherever
<div n="lb">falls the look of woman, there fall sharpened arrows; I
<div n="lb">think therefore that the God of Love runs before them while
<div n="lb">shooting off his arrows’. E. {#मा#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#ल्युट्#}.
