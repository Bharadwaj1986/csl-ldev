{#अपदिशम्#}¦ Avyayībh. Between two regions of the compass
(as south-east &c.). [The {%Siddhāntakaum.%} appears to assume
also a neuter {#अपदिश (-शम्)#} ‘intermediate space of the
compass’, since it explains {#अपदिशम्#} as representing the
value of the instrum. or locative of {#अपदिश#} viz. {#‘अपदिशम् ।#}
{#अपदिशेन । अपदिशम् । अपदिशे’;#} but the comm. on the
{%Amarak.%} I. 1. 2. 7. take the words {#‘क्लीवाव्ययम्’#} mentioned
there, expressly as meaning ‘Avyayībh.’ and as imparting
moreover to {#अप#} in {#अपदिशम्#} the meaning ‘in the middle of’.
{%Svāmin%} explains {#अपदिशम्#} as representing the value of a
case of {#दिश्#} (comp. Pāṇ. II. 1. 6), but {%Bhanūjid.%} refutes
him in contending that the word could not imply then the
notion of ‘in the middle of’: {#‘दिशोरिदमपदिशं विभक्त्यर्थे#}
{#ऽव्ययीभाव इति स्वामी । तन्न । संबन्धमात्रस्य विभक्त्यर्थत्वेऽपि#}
{#मध्यस्य तदर्थत्वाभावात्’#}.--It seems unnecessary, however,
[Page163-a+ 56]
to create a new meaning of {#अप#} on account of this com-
pound, as {#अपदिशम्#} could well signify literally ‘away from
one region and another’ i. e. between both. For a similar
interpretation of {#अप#} comp. {#अपसलवि#}.] E. {#अप#} and {#दिश्,#}
samās. aff. {#टच्,#} or {#अप#} and {#दिशा#}.
