taining Swarga or heaven. It is nitya or obligatory for
the complete performance of the Jyotiṣṭoma and so far
considered sometimes identical with it, while the other
six parts or Somasansthās of this sacrifice are considered
as kāmya and anitya, voluntary and supererogatory. (See
{#अत्यग्निष्टोम, उक्थ्य, षोडशिन्, अतिरात्र, अप्तोर्याम#} and

savana with five and the tṛtīya-savana with two stotras.

yajnīya (which begins with the words {#यज्ञायज्ञा वो अग्नये#} &c.
see Sāmaveda I. 1. 4. 1.), because it closes the ceremonies
of the Agniṣṭoma in the tṛtīya-savana. <sup>3</sup> The name of the
first day in the Sattra Pañchadaśarātra. <sup>5</sup> A proper name,
the son of the sixth Manu, Chākṣuṣa, by Naḍvalā, also
