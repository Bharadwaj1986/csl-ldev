{#अधीन#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-नः-ना-नम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Dependant. <sup>2</sup> Docile. E.
<div n="lb">{#अधि#} and {#इन#} ‘having a master over one's self’. This word
<div n="lb">and the etymology as mentioned, are given by the native
<div n="lb">lexicographers; but according to the best grammatical autho-
<div n="lb">rities {#अधीन#} would not exist as a real word. Words as {#रा-#}
<div n="lb">{#जाधीन, ब्राह्मणाधीन#} and the like, are explained by them as
<div n="lb">coming from {#राजाधि#} ({#राजन्#} and {#अधि#}), {#ब्राह्मणाधि#} ({#ब्राह्मण#}
<div n="lb">and {#अधि#}) with taddh. aff. {#ख,#} or by others as derived from {#रा-#}
<div n="lb">{#जन्, ब्राह्मण#} with taddh. aff. {#सधीनन्;#} it would seem therefore
<div n="lb">that the use of {#अधीन#} as an independant word is grammatically
<div n="lb">not correct. But see {#अध्यधीन#} and {#अनधीनक#}.
