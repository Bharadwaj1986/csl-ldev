{#अपराह्ण#}¦ Tatpur. m. n. ({#-ह्णः-ह्णम्#}) The last part of the day;
before sunset, e. g. {#अथ यदूर्ध्वमपराह्लात्प्रागस्तमयात्स उप-#}
[Page171-b+ 56]
{#द्रवः#} &c.; the fourth part of the day or three Muhūrtas
(= six Daṇḍas), if the day is divided into five equal parts,
({%Mitākṣara:%} {#अपराह्लश्च पञ्चधाविभक्ते दिने चतुर्थो भागस्त्रि-#}
{#मुहूर्तः#}).--Besides the last definition {%Rādhākāntadeva%} al-
leges the following from vaidik and law texts: the last por-
tion of the day, if the latter is divided into two halves;
or the third portion of the day, if it is divided into three
parts, i. e. the last ten Daṇḍas, if the division is into thirty
Daṇḍas.--[The neuter gender of the word is given on the
only authority of the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} II. 4. 31. and on that of
the {%Gaṇaratnam.,%} where it is also mentioned amongst the
{#अर्धर्चादि;#} but the {%Sūtra%} of {%Pāṇ.%} II. 4. 29. would be an ex-
plicit authority {%against%} the correctness of the neuter gender
of this word, at least at Pāṇini's period; comp. also the in-
stances to V. 4. 88. and VIII. 4. 7.; and it may be observed,
too, that the restriction, as regards the Dwigu compounds
the latter part of which is {#रात्रि,#} as {#द्विरात्रम्, त्रिरात्रम्#}
(II. 4. 29. v. 1.), belongs to a Vārttika which neither occurs
in the {%Mahābhāṣya%} nor in the {%Kāśikā;%} comp. also the masc.
forms {#द्विरात्रः, त्रिरात्रः,#} {%Kāśikā%} to {%Pāṇ.%} V. 4. 87.] E. {#अपर#}
(see I. 1. 3.) and {#अह्न,#} a substitute of {#अहन्#} (or as the Kā-
śikā explains: of {#अह,#} i. e. {#अपर#} and {#अहन्,#} samāsānta aff.
{#टच्#}), with the change of {#न्#} to {#ण#}.
