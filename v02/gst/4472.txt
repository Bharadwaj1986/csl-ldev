{#अप्#}¦ f. ({#-प्;#} in the classical literature only used in the plural:
<div n="lb">{#-आपः-अपः-अद्भिः-अद्भ्यः-अपाम्-अप्सु#}) <sup>1</sup> Water.--Ac-
<div n="lb">cording to the Hindu doctrine it is one of the five elements
<div n="lb">the several denominations of which are {#आकाश#} (æther),
<div n="lb">{#वायु#} (air), {#अग्नि#} (fire), {#अप्#} (water), {#पृथिवी#} (earth), (each
<div n="lb">of these being also replaced by synonymes, as {#आकाश#}
<div n="lb">by {#व्योमन्, वायु#} by {#मरुत्, अग्नि#} by {#तेजस्, अप्#} by
<div n="lb">{#वारि, पृथिवी#} by {#क्षिति#} &c.; comp. under {#आकाश#} &c.); the
<div n="lb">place, however, which {%water%} holds in the Hindu cosmogony
<div n="lb">varies according to the doctrines. Thus the {%Bṛhad-Āraṇ-%}
<div n="lb">{%yaka Upan.%} represents it as the first material creation, it
<div n="lb">being produced by Death after the creation of Soul; but
<div n="lb">its character in this Upanishad is not yet that of an element
<div n="lb">in the later sense of the word; nor is it such an element in
<div n="lb">the {%Aitareya-Upan.,%} where the order of the primitive ma-
<div n="lb">terial creation is {#अम्भस्#} (the waters above the heavens),
<div n="lb">{#मरीचि#} (the sphere of sunbeams or atmosphere), {#मर#} (the
<div n="lb">sphere of death or earth) and {#अप्#} (the sphere of waters
<div n="lb">beneath the earth).--In the {%Taittirīya-Upan.%} the order and
<div n="lb">successive origin of the elements is the same as in the Ve-
<div n="lb">dānta, viz. æther, in which originates air and thus suc-
<div n="lb">cessively fire, water, earth. But the {%Vedānta%} complicates
<div n="lb">this simple view by assuming a creation of subtle elements
<div n="lb">(see {#सूक्ष्मशरीर#}) æther &c., produced by Chaitanya or the
<div n="lb">worldly Brahman, whence arise through an intricate division
<div n="lb">and combination of the several parts of each, the material
<div n="lb">elements (see {#स्थूलशरीर#}) æther &c.; this system holds more-
<div n="lb">over that each successive element becomes possessed of the
<div n="lb">qualities of each preceding one, i. e. the quality of æther
<div n="lb">being sound, air obtains the qualities of sound and touch,
<div n="lb">and in a similar progress, fire the qualities of sound, touch
<div n="lb">and form, water of sound, touch, form and savour, earth
<div n="lb">of sound, touch, form, savour and odour.--According to
<div n="lb">the {%Sāṅkhya%} the coarse elements also arise from subtle ele-
<div n="lb">ments, but the latter ({#तन्मात्र#} q. v.), produced by Ahaṅkāra
<div n="lb">or the type of {%I,%} are the qualities sound, touch, form,
<div n="lb">savour and odour, æther proceeding from sound, air from
<div n="lb">touch, fire from form, water from savour and earth from
<div n="lb">odour. (Compare also Suśruta's mythological developement
<div n="lb">of the Sāṅkhya-Yoga: {#अव्यक्तं महानहंकारः पञ्च तन्मात्राणि चे-#}
<div n="lb">{#त्यष्टौ प्रकृतयः शेषाः षोडश विकाराः । स्वः स्वश्चैषां विषयोऽधि-#}
<div n="lb">{#भूतम् । स्वयमध्यात्ममधिदैवतं च । अथ बुद्धेर्ब्रह्मा । अहंकारस्ये-#}
<div n="lb">{#श्वरः । मनसश्चन्द्रमाः । दिशः श्रोत्रस्य । त्वचो वायुः । सूर्यश्चक्षु-#}
<div n="lb">{#षोः । रसनस्यापः । पृथिवी घ्राणस्य ।#} &c.)--The {%Nyāya%}
<div n="lb">systems, more especially the {%Vaiśeṣika,%} do not discuss the
<div n="lb">origin of these elements, the order of which they retain,
[Page156-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">but attach themselves chiefly to the definition of their
<div n="lb">properties; accord. to the {%Vaiśeṣika%} the qualities of water
<div n="lb">are touch, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, dis-
<div n="lb">junction, greater or less comprehensiveness (extension), ve-
<div n="lb">locity, gravity, fluidity, colour, savour and viscidity. (For
<div n="lb">those of the other elements see s. vv. {#आकाश#} &c.) The cos-
<div n="lb">mogony of {%Manu%} which is neither the pure Sāṅkhya nor the
<div n="lb">pure Vedānta doctrine (although Kullūka endeavours to ex-
<div n="lb">plain his terms as if they were pure Vedānta terms), but
<div n="lb">a theory apparently prior to both and combining their views,
<div n="lb">imagines the coarse elements as proceeding from the subtle
<div n="lb">portions of the seven intellectual creations--{#पुरुषाः#} which
<div n="lb">are, according to Kullūka, {#अहंकार, महत्#} and the five
<div n="lb">subtle elements(?)--and endowed with the same qualities
<div n="lb">as assigned to them by the Vedānta.--According to the
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇupurāṇa%} ‘elementary Egotism (the type of {%I,%} {#अहंकार#})
<div n="lb">becoming productive as the rudiment of sound, produced
<div n="lb">from it æther, of which sound is the characteristic, invest-
<div n="lb">ing it with its rudiment of sound; æther becoming produc-
<div n="lb">tive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated
<div n="lb">strong wind, the property of which is touch; and æther
<div n="lb">with the rudiment of sound, enveloped the rudiment of
<div n="lb">touch; then wind becoming productive, produced the rudi-
<div n="lb">ment of form (colour); whence fire proceeded of which form
<div n="lb">is the attribute, and the rudiment of touch enveloped the
<div n="lb">wind with the rudiment of colour; fire becoming productive
<div n="lb">produced the rudiment of savour, whence proceed all juices
<div n="lb">in which savour resides, and the rudiment of colour invested
<div n="lb">the juices with the rudiment of savour; the waters becoming
<div n="lb">productive engendered the rudiment of smell; whence an
<div n="lb">aggregate (earth) originates, of which smell is the property.’
<div n="lb">In a note to this passage ({%Viṣṇup.%} p. 16) Professor Wilson
<div n="lb">observes that ‘the successive series of rudiments and ele-
<div n="lb">ments and their respectively engendering the rudiments and
<div n="lb">elements next in order occur in most of the Purāṇas in
<div n="lb">nearly the same words’, that ‘some of the Purāṇas, as the
<div n="lb">{%Matsya, Vāyu, Linga, Bhāgavata%} and {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} add a
<div n="lb">description of a participation of properties amongst the ele-
<div n="lb">ments, which is rather Vedānta than Sāṅkhya’ and mentions
<div n="lb">a passage of the Moksha Dharma (vv. 6778. 6779) of the
<div n="lb">Māhābhārata which is an exception, since its order of the
<div n="lb">elements is æther, water, fire, air, earth. [On the cosmo-
<div n="lb">gony of the chapter in which these latter verses occur, Arju-
<div n="lb">namiśra has the following gloss: {#कोऽयं सर्गप्रकारः । न हि#}
<div n="lb">{#साङ्ख्यादिसर्गेष्वयं क्रमः । उच्यते । अन्योऽयं प्रकारः सर्गस्य ।#}
<div n="lb">{#पौराणिकादिसंमतेषु#} &c.; but he omits to say which Pu-
<div n="lb">rāṇas give this anomalous order of the elements.] For the
<div n="lb">Bhāgav. Pur. comp. III. 26. 29. ff. and the two verses VII.
<div n="lb">12. 25 and 30: {#खे खानि वायौ निःश्वासांस्तेजस्यूष्माणमात्मवान् ।#}
<div n="lb">{#अप्स्वसृक्श्लेष्मपूयानि क्षितौ शेषं यथोद्भवम्#} (scil. {#न्यसेत्#}); and
<div n="lb">{#अप्सु क्षितिमपो ज्योतिष्यदो वायौ नभस्यमुम् । कूटस्थे तच्च म-#}
<div n="lb">{#हति तदव्यक्तेऽक्षरे च तत्#} (this reverted order being that in
<div n="lb">which dissolution takes place).--In the Vedas, however,
<div n="lb">{#अपां गर्भः#} ‘the child of the waters’ is an epithet of Agni,
<div n="lb">‘because he comes forth from amid the waters’ or ‘because
<div n="lb">he resides as lightning amidst the rain-waters’ (according to
[Page156-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">Mahīdhara); comp. also {#गर्भो अपसाम्#} s. v. {#अपस्;#} from the
<div n="lb">same reason probably Agni is also called {#अपां#} or {#अपो#}
<div n="lb">{#नपात्#} ‘the grandson of the waters’, but, in Sāyaṇa's
<div n="lb">opinion, ‘because trees grow through the agency of water
<div n="lb">and fire comes (through the friction of the wood) of trees.
