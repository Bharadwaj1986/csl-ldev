{#अप्#}¦ f. ({#-प्;#} in the classical literature only used in the plural:
{#-आपः-अपः-अद्भिः-अद्भ्यः-अपाम्-अप्सु#}) <sup>1</sup> Water.--Ac-
cording to the Hindu doctrine it is one of the five elements
the several denominations of which are {#आकाश#} (æther),
{#वायु#} (air), {#अग्नि#} (fire), {#अप्#} (water), {#पृथिवी#} (earth), (each
of these being also replaced by synonymes, as {#आकाश#}
by {#व्योमन्, वायु#} by {#मरुत्, अग्नि#} by {#तेजस्, अप्#} by
{#वारि, पृथिवी#} by {#क्षिति#} &c.; comp. under {#आकाश#} &c.); the
place, however, which {%water%} holds in the Hindu cosmogony
varies according to the doctrines. Thus the {%Bṛhad-Āraṇ-%}
{%yaka Upan.%} represents it as the first material creation, it
being produced by Death after the creation of Soul; but
its character in this Upanishad is not yet that of an element
in the later sense of the word; nor is it such an element in
the {%Aitareya-Upan.,%} where the order of the primitive ma-
terial creation is {#अम्भस्#} (the waters above the heavens),
{#मरीचि#} (the sphere of sunbeams or atmosphere), {#मर#} (the
sphere of death or earth) and {#अप्#} (the sphere of waters
beneath the earth).--In the {%Taittirīya-Upan.%} the order and
successive origin of the elements is the same as in the Ve-
dānta, viz. æther, in which originates air and thus suc-
cessively fire, water, earth. But the {%Vedānta%} complicates
this simple view by assuming a creation of subtle elements
(see {#सूक्ष्मशरीर#}) æther &c., produced by Chaitanya or the
worldly Brahman, whence arise through an intricate division
and combination of the several parts of each, the material
elements (see {#स्थूलशरीर#}) æther &c.; this system holds more-
over that each successive element becomes possessed of the
qualities of each preceding one, i. e. the quality of æther
being sound, air obtains the qualities of sound and touch,
and in a similar progress, fire the qualities of sound, touch
and form, water of sound, touch, form and savour, earth
of sound, touch, form, savour and odour.--According to
the {%Sāṅkhya%} the coarse elements also arise from subtle ele-
ments, but the latter ({#तन्मात्र#} q. v.), produced by Ahaṅkāra
or the type of {%I,%} are the qualities sound, touch, form,
savour and odour, æther proceeding from sound, air from
touch, fire from form, water from savour and earth from
odour. (Compare also Suśruta's mythological developement
of the Sāṅkhya-Yoga: {#अव्यक्तं महानहंकारः पञ्च तन्मात्राणि चे-#}
{#त्यष्टौ प्रकृतयः शेषाः षोडश विकाराः । स्वः स्वश्चैषां विषयोऽधि-#}
{#भूतम् । स्वयमध्यात्ममधिदैवतं च । अथ बुद्धेर्ब्रह्मा । अहंकारस्ये-#}
{#श्वरः । मनसश्चन्द्रमाः । दिशः श्रोत्रस्य । त्वचो वायुः । सूर्यश्चक्षु-#}
{#षोः । रसनस्यापः । पृथिवी घ्राणस्य ।#} &c.)--The {%Nyāya%}
systems, more especially the {%Vaiśeṣika,%} do not discuss the
origin of these elements, the order of which they retain,
[Page156-a+ 56]
but attach themselves chiefly to the definition of their
properties; accord. to the {%Vaiśeṣika%} the qualities of water
are touch, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, dis-
junction, greater or less comprehensiveness (extension), ve-
locity, gravity, fluidity, colour, savour and viscidity. (For
those of the other elements see s. vv. {#आकाश#} &c.) The cos-
mogony of {%Manu%} which is neither the pure Sāṅkhya nor the
pure Vedānta doctrine (although Kullūka endeavours to ex-
plain his terms as if they were pure Vedānta terms), but
a theory apparently prior to both and combining their views,
imagines the coarse elements as proceeding from the subtle
portions of the seven intellectual creations--{#पुरुषाः#} which
are, according to Kullūka, {#अहंकार, महत्#} and the five
subtle elements(?)--and endowed with the same qualities
as assigned to them by the Vedānta.--According to the
{%Viṣṇupurāṇa%} ‘elementary Egotism (the type of {%I,%} {#अहंकार#})
becoming productive as the rudiment of sound, produced
from it æther, of which sound is the characteristic, invest-
ing it with its rudiment of sound; æther becoming produc-
tive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated
strong wind, the property of which is touch; and æther
with the rudiment of sound, enveloped the rudiment of
touch; then wind becoming productive, produced the rudi-
ment of form (colour); whence fire proceeded of which form
is the attribute, and the rudiment of touch enveloped the
wind with the rudiment of colour; fire becoming productive
produced the rudiment of savour, whence proceed all juices
in which savour resides, and the rudiment of colour invested
the juices with the rudiment of savour; the waters becoming
productive engendered the rudiment of smell; whence an
aggregate (earth) originates, of which smell is the property.’
In a note to this passage ({%Viṣṇup.%} p. 16) Professor Wilson
observes that ‘the successive series of rudiments and ele-
ments and their respectively engendering the rudiments and
elements next in order occur in most of the Purāṇas in
nearly the same words’, that ‘some of the Purāṇas, as the
{%Matsya, Vāyu, Linga, Bhāgavata%} and {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} add a
description of a participation of properties amongst the ele-
ments, which is rather Vedānta than Sāṅkhya’ and mentions
a passage of the Moksha Dharma (vv. 6778. 6779) of the
Māhābhārata which is an exception, since its order of the
elements is æther, water, fire, air, earth. [On the cosmo-
gony of the chapter in which these latter verses occur, Arju-
namiśra has the following gloss: {#कोऽयं सर्गप्रकारः । न हि#}
{#साङ्ख्यादिसर्गेष्वयं क्रमः । उच्यते । अन्योऽयं प्रकारः सर्गस्य ।#}
{#पौराणिकादिसंमतेषु#} &c.; but he omits to say which Pu-
rāṇas give this anomalous order of the elements.] For the
Bhāgav. Pur. comp. III. 26. 29. ff. and the two verses VII.
12. 25 and 30: {#खे खानि वायौ निःश्वासांस्तेजस्यूष्माणमात्मवान् ।#}
{#अप्स्वसृक्श्लेष्मपूयानि क्षितौ शेषं यथोद्भवम्#} (scil. {#न्यसेत्#}); and
{#अप्सु क्षितिमपो ज्योतिष्यदो वायौ नभस्यमुम् । कूटस्थे तच्च म-#}
{#हति तदव्यक्तेऽक्षरे च तत्#} (this reverted order being that in
which dissolution takes place).--In the Vedas, however,
{#अपां गर्भः#} ‘the child of the waters’ is an epithet of Agni,
‘because he comes forth from amid the waters’ or ‘because
he resides as lightning amidst the rain-waters’ (according to
[Page156-b+ 56]
Mahīdhara); comp. also {#गर्भो अपसाम्#} s. v. {#अपस्;#} from the
same reason probably Agni is also called {#अपां#} or {#अपो#}
{#नपात्#} ‘the grandson of the waters’, but, in Sāyaṇa's
opinion, ‘because trees grow through the agency of water
and fire comes (through the friction of the wood) of trees.

is the liturgical name of the Sāmav. verses 2. 25. 26. (= II. 1.
1. 9.) and 2. 47-49. (= II. 1. 1. 18.); {#अपां साम#} of 1. 544. (= I. 6.
1. 4. 12.); {#अपामीवम्#} of 2. 502-504. (= II. 4. 2. 7.); {#अपां निधिः#}
of 1. 151. (= I. 2. 2. 1. 7.); {#अपां सर्पम्#} of the Āraṇyagāna (of
the Sāmav.) II. 7. (not in the Sāmav.). <sup>2</sup> (ved.) The same as
{#अन्तरिक्ष#}. <sup>3</sup> (In Astronomy.) The star <lang n="greek">δ</lang> {%Virginis.%} [Com-
pounds the latter part of which is {#अप्#} assume the samās. aff.
{#अ,#} e. g. {#प्र#} or {#परा#} and {#अप्#} form {#प्राप, पराप;#} but some-
times the word remains unchanged, if it is a Bahuvr. com-
pound, e. g. {#स्वप्, बह्वप्#} (in which case the neuter plur. is
{#स्वाम्पि, बह्वाम्पि#}); if the first part of the compound is {#अनु,#}
the grammarians assume that {#अप्#} becomes {#ऊप्#} provided
the meaning refers to a place, i. e. {#अनूप#} (comp. also {#सूप#});
if it is {#द्वि, अन्तर्#} or a prepositional prefix not ending in
{#अ#} or {#आ,#} that {#अप्#} becomes {#ईप्;#} comp. {#द्वीप, अन्तरीप,#}
{#नीप, वीप, अन्वीप, प्रतीप, समीप#} ({#समाप#} being an ex-
ception); if the prepos. prefix ends in {#अ#} or {#आ,#} that {#अप्#}
may change to {#ईप्#} or not; comp. {#प्राप#} or {#प्रेप, पराप#} or
{#परेप#}.--(Another explanation of these compounds will be
found in the Preface.)].--Compare also {#अप#} and {#अपस्#}.
E. {#आप्,#} uṇ. aff. {#क्विप्#} with the shortening of the initial
vowel. For another etym. see the Preface.
