{#अभ्यवहार्य#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-र्यः-र्या-र्यम्#}) Fit to be taken
as food (solid or liquid); e. g. {%Vārtt.%} 1. to {%Pāṇ.%} VII. 3. 69.:
{#भोज्यमभ्यवहार्यमिति वक्तव्यम्,#} with which words {%Kātyāyana%}
criticizes {%Pāṇini%} for having either restricted the sense of
{#भोज्य#} to that of {#भक्ष्य#} (‘fit to serve as solid food’) or used
{#भक्ष्य#} in the general acceptation of {#अभ्यवहार्य#}. {%Patanjali,%} it
[Page311-a+ 56]
is true, defends {%Pāṇini%} (as he frequently sides with {%Pāṇini%}
against the hypercriticisms of {%Kātyāyana%}) also on this oc-
casion by alleging {#अब्भक्ष#} and {#वायुभक्ष#} in evidence that {#भक्ष्#}
(and, impliedly, that {#भक्ष्य#}) are used in a general sense;
but on another occasion when he shows that there are
words the bearing of which in the classical language can
merely be established from the context in which they occur
in the vaidik literature, and not be made out otherwise (see
{#एकपद#}), he gives these very instances as a proof of his
latter assertion, and admitting therefore that they belong to
this exceptional category, corroborates thus involuntarily
the view of {%Kātyāy.%} that {#भक्ष्#} cannot be applied to the word
{#अप्#} in a {%general sense,%} and much less to any other word
having the sense of a liquid substance ({%Patanj. Introd.:%}
{#अथवा सन्त्येकपदान्यप्यवधारणानि तद्यथा । अब्भक्षो वायुभक्ष#}
{#इति । अप एव भक्षयति वायुमेव भक्षयतीति गम्यते । एवमि-#}
{#हापि सिद्ध एव न साध्य इति;#} {%Kaiyy.:%} {#एवशब्दप्रयोगे द्विपद-#}
{#मवधारणम् । द्योतकत्वेन एवशब्दस्यापेक्षणात् । यदा तु द्योत-#}
{#कमन्तरेण सामर्थ्यादवधारणं गम्यते तदा तदेकपदमित्युच्यते#}
{#तत्र सर्व एवापो भक्षयन्तीत्यब्भक्षश्रुतिः सामर्थ्यान्नियममवगम-#}
{#यति । अप एवेति । इहापि नित्यानित्यव्यतिरेकेण राश्यन्तरा-#}
{#भावात्सिद्धशब्दोपादानान्नियमोऽवगम्यते#}). But as {#भक्ष्#} {%is%}
applied to {#अप्,#} in the vaidik language, and as it seems
strange that {%Pāṇini%} should have erred in the use of so
common words as {#भोज्य#} or {#भक्ष्य,#} it is possible also to ob-
tain another result from this discussion of {%Patanjali,%} which
would reconcile the observations he makes in his Introd.,
with those he has appended to the quoted Sūtra, a result
supported by many {%Sūtras%} of {%Pāṇini,%} viz. that {%Kātyāyana,%}
far from being a contemporary of {%Pāṇini,%} as is stated in
one of the ghost stories of the {%Kathāsaritsāgara,%} has lived,
on the contrary, at another period, and that many {%Vārttikas%}
of his must not be looked upon {%by us%} as impugning the ac-
curacy of {%Pāṇini'%}s rules at the time when this grammarian
wrote, but as commenting upon, extending and restricting
the validity of these rules at a probably much later period
of the Sanskṛt literature. See my Preface to the {%Mānava-%}
{%Kalpa-Sūtras.%}
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-र्यम्#}) Food (in general); e. g. {%Rāmāy.:%} {#शुची-#}
{#न्यभ्यवहार्याणि मूलानि च फलानि च;#} or {%Kāśikā:%} {#सतृणमभ्य-#}
{#वहरति । न किंचिदभ्यवहार्यं त्यजतीत्यर्थः;#} or {#खरविशदमभ्य-#}
{#वहार्यं भक्षशब्देनोच्यते#}. E. {#हृ#} with {#अव#} and {#अभि,#} kṛtya aff. {#ण्यत्#}.
