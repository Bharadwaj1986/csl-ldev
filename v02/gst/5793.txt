<div n="lb">ocean.
<div n="P">2. <sup>a.</sup> m. sing. ({#-जः#}) <sup>1</sup> The moon; comp. {#अब्ज#}. <sup>2</sup> (In

<div n="lb">(The meaning ‘moon’ is not given in the Koshas; but as
<div n="lb">the word occurs in the second meaning, in a mathematical
<div n="lb">Index, similarly as {#अमृतदीधिति,#} and as the synonymes
<div n="lb">of {#चन्द्र#} q. v. are used likewise so, it seemed to me neces-
<div n="lb">sary to infer this mathematical application from the mean-
<div n="lb">ing ‘moon’, which would arise from the etymon of the
<div n="lb">word in the same way as {#अब्ज#} 2. 1. q. v. Comp. also {#श्वे-#}
<div n="lb">{#तधामन्#} ‘moon and cuttle fish bone’.)
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> m. du. ({#-जौ#}) A name of the Aśvins q. v., these two

<div n="lb">ing come from the ocean when it was churned for the amṛta.
