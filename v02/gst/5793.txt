{#अब्धिज#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-जः-जा-जम्#}) Born in or by the
ocean.
<div n="P">2. <sup>a.</sup> m. sing. ({#-जः#}) <sup>1</sup> The moon; comp. {#अब्ज#}. <sup>2</sup> (In
mathematical language sometimes used to denote) the nu-
meral {%1.%} <sup>3</sup> Cuttle fish bone; the same as {#अब्धिकफ#} or {#स-#}
{#मुद्रफेन#} (according to the {%Nigh. Prak.%}), comp. also {#अर्णवज#}.
(The meaning ‘moon’ is not given in the Koshas; but as
the word occurs in the second meaning, in a mathematical
Index, similarly as {#अमृतदीधिति,#} and as the synonymes
of {#चन्द्र#} q. v. are used likewise so, it seemed to me neces-
sary to infer this mathematical application from the mean-
ing ‘moon’, which would arise from the etymon of the
word in the same way as {#अब्ज#} 2. 1. q. v. Comp. also {#श्वे-#}
{#तधामन्#} ‘moon and cuttle fish bone’.)
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> m. du. ({#-जौ#}) A name of the Aśvins q. v., these two
gods having sprung from the ocean when it was churned
for the amṛta.
<div n="P">3. n. ({#-जम्#}) Salt (according to the {%Nigh. Prak.%}).
<div n="P">4. f. ({#-जा#}) Spirituous liquor; see {#सुरा,#} the latter hav-
ing come from the ocean when it was churned for the amṛta.
E. {#अब्धि#} and {#ज#}.
