{#अपची#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-ची#}) (In Medicine.) A disease consisting
in ‘a number of tumors some of which are of the size of
an Amalaka-stone and others like spawn, which cause
itching, but otherwise little pain, burst, suppurate and dis-
appear when others come again’. E. accord. to Suśruta
{#अप#} and {#ची,#} i. e. ‘a bad gathering’; for he writes {#‘(ग्रन्थि-#}
{#भिः) अनन्यवर्णैरुपचीयमानं चयप्रकर्षादपचीं वदन्ति’;#} an
etym. ‘{#अ#} and {#पच#}’ would not merely be at variance with
its femin. form. in {#ई,#} but with the nature of the disease
itself, since the tumors so called attain maturity; for they
burst and suppurate: {#‘कण्डूयुतास्तेऽल्परुजः प्रभिन्नाः स्रवन्ति#}
{#नश्यन्ति भवन्ति चान्ये’#}.
