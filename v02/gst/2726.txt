<div n="lb">Kāmadeva by Śubhāṅgī or, according to others, Kaku-
<div n="lb">dvatī, the daughter of Rukmin; his wife is Uṣā, the
<div n="lb">daughter of Vāna, or, according to others, Subhadrā, the
<div n="lb">granddaughter of Rukmin, and his son Vajra.--The
<div n="lb">Vaiṣṇava sect, called Pāñcharātra or Bhāgavatas, con-
<div n="lb">sider him as an incarnation or part of Viṣṇu and identify

<div n="lb">and {#निरुद्ध#}. (It is doubtful whether the meaning 1. 3. (move-
<div n="lb">able) or the meaning 2. 4. (spy) is the correct one, the
<div n="lb">translation being founded on the word {#चर,#} given as one
<div n="lb">of the meanings of {#अनिरुद्ध,#} but without any further in-
<div n="lb">dication as to the gender. From the place, however, {#चर#}
<div n="lb">occupies in the explanation of some of the native dictio-
<div n="lb">naries, the meaning ‘spy’ is likely to be preferable to the
<div n="lb">meaning ‘moveable’.)
