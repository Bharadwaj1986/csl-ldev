{#अतिरात्र#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-त्रः#}) <sup>1</sup> The name of the fifth part or Soma-
sansthā of the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice, for the complete per-
formance of which, however, it is not considered nitya, es-
sential or obligatory but kāmya, voluntary, viz. if the sacri-
ficer institutes it for the sake of progeny, and therefore anitya,
not always taking place, supererogatory. (See {#अग्निष्टोम#}.)
<sup>2</sup> The usual beginning and concluding part of those Ahargaṇa
sacrifices which are called Sattra (q. v.) and the beginning or
the concluding part of those which are called Ahīna (q. v.).
There are, however, exceptions to this rule, see f. i. {#पञ्चदश-#}
{#रात्र, कुण्डपायिनामयन#}. <sup>3</sup> The name of the Sāmaveda verse
which closes the ceremonies of the sacrifices mentioned before.
<sup>4</sup> A proper name, the son of Chākṣuṣa or the sixth Manu by
Nadvalā. E. {#अति#} (sc. {#क्रान्तः#}) and {#रात्रि#} (in the sense of
the accusative), samāsānta aff. {#अच्;#} properly meaning ‘last-
ing beyond a night’.
