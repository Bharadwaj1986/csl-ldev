{#अथ#}¦ ind. An inceptive and auspicious particle. It serves to
introduce the beginning of a work, a chapter, a sentence
and with respect to the latter may imply doubt or inter-
rogation or may serve as a conjunctive or disjunctive par-
ticle. It may be accompanied by those particles or words
which themselves are used in the same sense, giving them
greater emphasis, especially by {#उ, अतस्, अनन्तरम्, किम्,#}
{#तु, पुनर्, वा, किमु, अपि#}. Without or with these particles
{#अथ#} corresponds therefore with: <sup>1</sup> Now (inceptive or pre-
mising); in the same sense but with greater emphasis {#अथो#}
({#अथ#} and {#उ#}), {#अथातस्, अथानन्तरम्#}. <sup>2</sup> Why? what? (in-
terrogatively and doubtingly); (likewise {#अथवा#}.) <sup>3</sup> How
else? certainly; (in the same sense {#अथकिम्#}.) <sup>4</sup> But, on the
contrary; (in the same sense {#अथ तु, अथ पुनर्#}.) <sup>5</sup> Or, or
rather; (likewise {#अथवा, अथवापि, अथापि वा#} &c.) <sup>6</sup> More-
over, so much the more, therefore, thus; (likewise {#अथच,#}
{#अथापि, अथो अपि, अथ किमु#}.) In the Vedas there occurs
also the protracted form {#अथा#} which seems to be the more
original one; (cf. {#तथा#} and {#यथा#}). E. According to the native
authorities from {#अर्थ्,#} kṛt aff. {#ड#} with {#र्#} being dropped;
but it is more probably derived from {#अ,#} the pron. theme
which is considered as a substitute for {#इदम्#} (pointing to
what follows), taddh. aff. {#थ#}.
