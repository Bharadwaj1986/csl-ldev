{#अन्तःकरण#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-णम्#}) (In Philosophy.) <sup>1</sup> The interior
sense (also called {#आभ्यन्तरकरण#}) opposed to the {#वाह्यकरण#}
(q. v.) or exterior sense; this notion which in general may
be termed {%‘the faculty of thinking’%} is thus modified in the
Vedānta and in the Sāṅkhya: <sup>a</sup> (In the Vedānta it implies)
the notion of what is the general substratum of {#आत्मन्#} or
Soul (Śaṅkara: {#तच्चात्मन उपाधिभूतमन्तःकरणम्#}); its activity
becomes manifest in two of the seventeen {#सूक्ष्मशरीर#} (q. v.)
or subtle bodies of creation, viz. in the {#बुद्धि#} (q. v.) or that
mental activity which forms positive conclusions, and in
the {#मनस्,#} or that mental activity which ‘discerns and doubts’;
[Page115-a+ 56]
and as {#चित्त#} or ‘logical combination’ is involved by the
activity of {#बुद्धि,#} and {#अहङ्कार#} or ‘self-consciousness’ is in-
volved by {#मनस्,#} the activity of the {#अन्तःकरण#} is fourfold,
viz. as that of {#बुद्धि, मनस्, चित्त#} and {#अहङ्कार#}. Śaṅkara in
his commentary on the Vedānta Sūtras varies slightly in this
respect by substituting {#विज्ञान#} for {#अहङ्कार;#} the difference
however is merely apparent, {#विज्ञान,#} worldly knowledge,
being also one of the attributes of {#मनस्#} (Śaṅkara: {#‘अन्तः-#}
{#करणं मनो बुद्धिर्विज्ञानं चित्तमिति चानेकधा तत्र तत्राभि-#}
{#लप्यते’#}). <sup>b.</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya it is not the substratum of {#पुरुष#}
or Soul but) the generic name and characteristic of three
successive productions of {#प्रकृति#} or Matter, viz. of {#बुद्धि#} ‘as-
certainment or positive conclusion’, of its product {#अहङ्कार#}
self-consciousness’ and of the product of Ahaṅkāra, viz.
{#मनस्#} which in this philosophy means ‘an organ both of sen-
sation and of action’ (see {#बुद्धीन्द्रिय#} and {#कर्मेन्द्रिय#}), ‘the
organ of volition’ (see {#सङ्कल्प#}). ‘The ten external organs
(viz the five organs of sensation and the five of action)
supply the objects for the ‘interior sense’, their time is the
present time, while the interior sense embraces the past,
present and future time’. <sup>2</sup> (In the non-philosophical lite-
rature where philosophical terms are usually employed in
a vague manner, this word means) Mind, heart, feeling,
a synonyme of {#मनस्#} in its vague, unphilosophical sense;
e. g. (in a verse of the Mālatīmādhava where an apparent
show is made of philosophical accuracy) {#प्रेमार्द्राः प्रणयस्पृ-#}
{#शः…चेष्टा भवेयुर्मयि । यास्वन्तःकरणस्य वाह्यकरणव्यापा-#}
{#ररोधीक्षणादाशंसापरिकल्पितास्वपि भवत्यानन्दसान्द्रोदयः#}
(var. lect. {#°सान्द्रो लयः#})--E. {#अन्तर्#} and {#करण#}.
