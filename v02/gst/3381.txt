{#अनुशय#}¦ Tatpur. I. m. ({#-यः#}) <sup>1</sup> Connexion, attachment; comp.
{#अनुशयिन्#}. <sup>2</sup> (In the Vedānta philos.) That consequence of
an act which compels the soul to descend again on earth,
after she has enjoyed in the other world those consequences
of her acts which allowed her to soar; that consequence,
as it were, that cleaves to the soul and does not permit
her to enjoy freedom from transmigration ({#‘आमुष्मिकफले#}
{#कर्मजाते उपभुक्तेऽवशिष्टमैहिकफलं कर्मान्तरजातमनुशयः’#});
the {#अनुशय#} varies according to its qualities; if it is ‘hand-
some’ ({#रमणीय#}) the soul is reborn as a ‘Brāhmaṇa, Ksha-
triya or Vaiśya’; if it is ‘contemptible’ ({#कपूय#}) it animates
‘a dog, a hog or a Chānḍāla’. <sup>3</sup> Repentance, regret. <sup>4</sup> Hatred,
[Page105-a+ 56]
resentment. <sup>5</sup> Deep or intense enmity, enmity which goes
far in its consequences; e. g. {#शिशुपालोऽनुशयं परं गतः#}
(comm.: {#परमनुशयं केवलं न सप्तव्यः किं तु हन्तव्यश्चेति दीर्घ-#}
{#द्वेषं गतः#}). <sup>6</sup> A certain country or place (? the meaning thus
rendered in a comm. is {#देशविशेष#}).
<div n="P">II. f. ({#-यी#}) (In Medicine.) <sup>1</sup> A disease of the feet, a small
abscess on the upper part, ‘deep, causing little pain, and of
the natural colour as the limb’. <sup>2</sup> (According to another)
An abscess on the head ({#मस्तकोपरि#}) of the same symptoms
as described before. E. {#शी#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#अच्;#} the
femin. in {#ई#} would be an anomaly accord. to this etym.
