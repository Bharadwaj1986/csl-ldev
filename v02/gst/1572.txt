{#अथर्वी#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-वी#}). This word occurs only in the Veda
<div n="lb">and is explained ‘not going, unable to move’, from {#अ#}
<div n="lb">neg. and {#थर्वी#} (from {#थर्व्,#} to go). It would seem, how-
<div n="lb">ever, that it is a Tatpur. composed of the obsolete word
<div n="lb">{#अथर्,#} fire, and {#वी,#} ‘surrounded by fire’(?). See the E.
<div n="lb">of {#अथर्वन्#} and {#अथरी#}.
