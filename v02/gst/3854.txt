{#अन्तर्दशाह#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-हः#}) A period of time within ten
<div n="lb">days. [I may observe that the only passage, to my
<div n="lb">knowledge, where this word is not used in the locative
<div n="lb">viz. in the present editions of Manu 8. 222, where it occurs
<div n="lb">in the ablat. {#अन्तर्दशाहात्#} has a various reading in the
<div n="lb">Vivādachintām. p. 56. 1. 12 {#अन्तर्दशाहे#} which appears to be
<div n="lb">preferable (the Mitākṣ. in both editions of the Vyavah.
<div n="lb">section p. 70 a. 1. 10 and p. 264. 1. 7 as well as the E. I. H.
<div n="lb">Mss. of it agree with the edd. of Manu); but if the reading
<div n="lb">{#°हे#} be correct, and the word did not occur in another case
<div n="lb">but the loc., it would become doubtful whether {#अन्तर्दशाहे#}
<div n="lb">does not represent two distinct words instead of a com-
<div n="lb">pound.] E. {#अन्तर्#} and {#दशाह#}.
