{#अन्तर्दशाह#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-हः#}) A period of time within ten
days. [I may observe that the only passage, to my
knowledge, where this word is not used in the locative
viz. in the present editions of Manu 8. 222, where it occurs
in the ablat. {#अन्तर्दशाहात्#} has a various reading in the
Vivādachintām. p. 56. 1. 12 {#अन्तर्दशाहे#} which appears to be
preferable (the Mitākṣ. in both editions of the Vyavah.
section p. 70 a. 1. 10 and p. 264. 1. 7 as well as the E. I. H.
Mss. of it agree with the edd. of Manu); but if the reading
{#°हे#} be correct, and the word did not occur in another case
but the loc., it would become doubtful whether {#अन्तर्दशाहे#}
does not represent two distinct words instead of a com-
pound.] E. {#अन्तर्#} and {#दशाह#}.
