{#अभिधर्म#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-र्मः#}) (In Buddhistic doctrine.) The mani-
fested or revealed truth; ({%Abhidharmakośa,%} as quoted in
{%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%} p. 40: = {#अभिमुखो धर्मः;#} therefore not to be
rendered: the ‘supreme law’; {#धर्म#} has been translated here
‘truth’, instead of ‘law’, in conformity with the judicious
remark of {%Spence Hardy, East. Mon.%} p. 167); i. e. the Bud-
dhistic dogmas and metaphysics, as laid down in the {#अ-#}
{#भिधर्मपिटक#} q. v.--The first redaction of the Abhidharma
is ascribed to {%Kāśyapa%} or {%Mahā-Kaśyapa,%} the principal
disciple of {%Śākya Muni;%} but the redaction of the whole col-
lection of works on this subject seems to belong to different
periods the last of which precedes the third Buddhistic
synod; (see {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} vol. II. p. 458). {%Hodgson%} re-
lates of four great {%Nepalese%} schools divided on account of
their views on the Abhidharma: the {%Svābhāvika, Aiśvarika,%}
{%Kārmika%} and {%Yātnika%} (see {%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%} p. 441 and the
quotation given there); {%Csoma de Körös%} speaks of four
other {%Tibetian%} schools which are divided and subdivided
into various sects: 1. the {%Vaibhāṣikās%} which comprise four
sects: {%a.%} one founded by {%Rāhula,%} the son of Śākya, and
subdivided at the period of the third synod into seven sects:
the Mūla-sarvāsti-vādās, Kāśyapīyās, Mahīśāsakās, Dhar-
maguptās, Bahuśrutīyās, Tāmraśātīyās and Vibhādyavā-
dinas; {%b.%} one founded by {%Kāśyapa,%} a Brāhmaṇa, and sub-
divided into six sects, five of which, bearing the collective
name of Mahāsaṅghikās, were known at the time of the
third synod: the Pūrvaśailās, Avaraśailās, Haimavatās,
Lokottaravādinas and Prajnaptivādinas; {%c.%} one founded by
{%Upāli,%} a Śūdra, and having the surname Sammatās, sub-
divided into three sects: the Kaurmakullakās (?), Āvan-
tikās and Vātsīputrīyās; {%d.%} one founded by {%Kātyāyana,%} a
Śūdra, and subdivided also into three sects: the Mahāvi-
hāravāsinas, Jyetavanīyās and Abhayagirivāsinas; 2. the
{%Sautrāntikās%} with two sects; 3. the {%Yogāchārās,%} founded by
{%Āryasaṅgha%} and divided into nine sects; 4. the {%Mādhyami-%}
{%kās%} owing their origin to {%Nāgārjuna%} who lived about 400
years after the Buddha, divided into two sects the founders
of which are probably {%Āryadeva%} and {%Buddhapālita.%} (For
these sects and the doctrine itself see {%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%}
p. 437 ff., {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} II. p. 456 ff.; also {%Spence Hardy'%}s
{%East. Mon.%} where a legend, related p. 197, conveys an idea
of the great merit supposed to be acquired by the study of
the Abhidharma.) E. {#अभि#} and {#धर्म#}.
