{#अन्यलक्षणोपपत्ति#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-त्तिः#}) The taking place (of some-
[Page145-b+ 56]
thing) in consequence of the symptom i. e. the existence (of
something else) being found somewhere else; in a Nyāya
Sūtra, where the possibility of non-existence is argued from
the circumstance that the existence of the counter-entity
might be elsewhere: {#असत्यर्थे नाभाव इति चेन्नान्यलक्षणोपपत्तेः#}
‘if (you say that there is) no non-existence since the thing
is not, it is not so, for (non-existence) might be, since (the
counter-entity) might exist elsewhere’. E. {#अन्य#} (in the sense
of a locative) {#-लक्षण#} (of an instrum.) and {#उपपत्ति#}.
