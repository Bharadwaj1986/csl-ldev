[{#अन्यक#}.¦ N. B. The forms {#अन्यके, अन्यकेषाम्#} are not to be re-
<div n="lb">ferred to a base {#अन्यक,#} but belong to {#अन्य#} q. v. which word
<div n="lb">like other {#सर्वनामन्#} q. v. may assume the affix {#अकच्#} placed
<div n="lb">before the endings. Such is the theory of Pāṇini, and it is
<div n="lb">countenanced not only by the pronominal declension endings
<div n="lb">of {#अन्यके#} &c. but by the analogy of a similar intrusion of
<div n="lb">{#क#} in the middle of verbal forms such as {#भिन्द्धकि, छिन्द्धकि#}
<div n="lb">‘he cuts badly or a little’.]
