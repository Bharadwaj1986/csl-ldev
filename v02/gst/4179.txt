[{#अन्यक#}.¦ N. B. The forms {#अन्यके, अन्यकेषाम्#} are not to be re-
ferred to a base {#अन्यक,#} but belong to {#अन्य#} q. v. which word
like other {#सर्वनामन्#} q. v. may assume the affix {#अकच्#} placed
before the endings. Such is the theory of Pāṇini, and it is
countenanced not only by the pronominal declension endings
of {#अन्यके#} &c. but by the analogy of a similar intrusion of
{#क#} in the middle of verbal forms such as {#भिन्द्धकि, छिन्द्धकि#}
‘he cuts badly or a little’.]
