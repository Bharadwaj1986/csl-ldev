{#अपस्#}¦ I. 1. n. ({#-पः#}) <sup>1</sup> Action, act, esp. a religious or sacri-
ficial act. (ved.) <sup>2</sup> Water. [It is very doubtful whether
the word is correct in the latter sense, as a {%neuter sing.;%}
comp. I. 2., it occurs as such in the following Sūtra of
{%Kaṇāda%} (E. I. H. Ms. 232) where the reading {#अपस्#} however
may be a mistake for {#आपस्,#} viz. {#पृथिव्यपस्तेजो वायुरा-#}
{#काशं कालो दिगात्मा मन इति द्रव्याणि ॥#}.] Compare also
{#आपस्#}. E. {#आप्,#} uṇ. aff. {#असुन्,#} the vowel of the radical
being shortened; but more probably of {#अप्,#} comp. the E.
of {#अप्त#} and see the Preface.
<div n="P">2. f. plur. ({#-सः#}) (ved.) Water (comp. {#अप्#}); e. g. {#बह्वी-#}
{#नां गर्भोऽपसाम्#} ‘(Agni) is the child of abundant waters’;
(according to {%Sāyaṇa,%} because he comes as lightning from the
waters collected in the clouds; comp. {#अपां गर्भः#} s. v. {#अप्#}).
E. {#आप्,#} uṇ. {#असि;#} and as before but see the Preface.
<div n="P">II. 1. m. f. plur. ({#-सः-सः#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Active, engaged in pursuits
in general, more esp. in the performance of religious or
sacrificial acts; in the femin. also as an epithet of the fingers.
<sup>2</sup> Fulfilling an act or business; as an epithet of {#त्रिधातवः#}
or ‘the three worlds upheld by the three divinities Fire,
Wind and Sun’, ‘cold, heat, wind, rain &c.’ being, as
{%Mahīdhara%} explains, ‘the doings of the world’. <sup>3</sup> Possessing
activity (or perhaps, referring to religious acts) as an epi-
thet of {#त्रिधातवः,#} when, according to {%Mahīdhara,%} in the
sense of {#पशु#} or sacrificial animal. <sup>4</sup> Rapid, swift; as a
river; comp. {#अपस्तम#}.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-पाः#}) The name of one of the seven Prajāpatis
in the second or the Manwantara of Svārochiṣa, according
to the Mātsya Purāṇa. E. {#अपस्,#} with luk of the taddh.

<div n="P">III. ind. A further developement of the prefix {#अप#} in com-
bination with the inflected forms, and in composition with
some derivatives, of {#कॄ#} q. v.; comp. {#अपस्कर#}. The native
theory considers however {#अपस्किरते#} &c. as {#अप#} and {#किरते#}
&c. with āgama {#सुट्;#} see the Preface.
