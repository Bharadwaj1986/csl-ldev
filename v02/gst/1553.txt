{#अथरी#}¦ f. (occurs only as a plural in the Vedas; {#-र्यः#}) The
<div n="lb">finger. E. This word is given as an irregular derivation
<div n="lb">from {#अत्#} ‘to go constantly’; but it is more probable that
<div n="lb">it is derived, with aff. {#अरि,#} from an obsolete rad. {#अथ्#}
<div n="lb">which seems to have had the same meaning as {#अत्#} (cf.
<div n="lb">{#अट्#} and {#अठ्#}), but is found only in {#अथरी, अथर्वन्#} and their
<div n="lb">derivatives, implying quickness or agility. The same etymo-
<div n="lb">logical connexion between words meaning ‘finger’ and ‘fire’
<div n="lb">may be perceived in other derivations from a radical in the
<div n="lb">sense of ‘to go’ f. i. in {#अङ्गुलि#} or {#अङ्गुरि, अग्रू#} and {#अग्नि, अङ्गिरस्,#}
<div n="lb">from {#अङ्ग्#}. It reappears distinctly in the denom. {#अथर्य्#} and
<div n="lb">its derivatives {#अथर्य, अथर्यु#} qq. vv.
