{#अग्न्याधान#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) The placing of the fire on the
ground previously prepared for it (see {#अग्निचयन#}); a cere-
mony which is necessary to make the Āhavanīya and the
other sacred fires (see {#अग्नि#}) fit for sacrificial use and is fol-
lowed by the Pavamāneṣtis (q. v.). See {#अग्निसंस्कार#}. The
act takes place in the spring, if the person belongs to the
cast of the Brāhmaṇas, in the hot season or grīṣma if he
is a Kshatriya, in the autumn or śarad if he is a Vaiśya
and is performed once for all, to serve all future purposes.
