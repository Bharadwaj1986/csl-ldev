{#अप्रतीत#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-तः-ता-तम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Not encountered,
unattackable (by enemies), a vaidik epithet, in the {%Ṛgveda,%}
esp. of Indra; e. g. {#अपूरुषघ्नो अप्रतीत शूर#} &c., also of a
horse; in the {%Vājasan.%} and {%Atharvav.,%} also of {%Viṣṇu%} and
{%Varuṇa:%} {#अप्रतीता सहोभिर्विष्णू#} &c. <sup>2</sup> Not understood, not
clearly intelligible, as a word; being {#अप्रतीत#} is according
to the {%Kāvyaprakāśa%} one of the seventeen, according to the
{%Sāhityadarpaṇa%} one of the thirteen defects of a word,
which must be avoided in composition; a word is defined
as {#अप्रतीत#} in these works, if it is used in a sense which
it properly has not or may have only in a certain work, as
if in the sentence {#सम्यग्ज्ञानमहाज्योतिर्दलिताशयताजुषः ।#}
{#विधीयमानमप्येतन्न भवेत्कर्मबन्धनम्,#} or in the sentence {#यो-#}
{#गेन दलिताशयः#} the word {#आशय#} is used in the sense {#वासना#}
which it has only in the Yoga philosophy.--See also
{#दोष#} and {#पददोष#}. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#प्रतीति#}.
