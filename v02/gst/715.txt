Twelve angulas make a vitasti or span, and twenty-four
a hasta or cubit. <sup>4</sup> (In astronomy.) A digit or one twelfth
part of any dimension, subdivided into sixty vyangulas.
E. {#अङ्गुल#} is considered by the gramm. authorities as a sub-
stitute of {#अङ्गुलि,#} as which it ought to occur only at the end
of certain Tatpur., derived then with samāsānta aff. {#अच्#} and
at the end of certain Bahuvr., derived with samāsānta aff. {#षच्#}.
In both cases it is a neutre. The native dictionaries how-
ever state as above.
