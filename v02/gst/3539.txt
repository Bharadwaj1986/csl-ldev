{#अनूप#}¦ I. 1. Bahuvr. 1. m. f. n. ({#-पः-पा-पम्#}) Watery, rich in
water. 2. m. ({#-पः#}) (Used in a comm. of the Rāmāyaṇa also
as a neuter: {#-पम्#}.) <sup>1</sup> A moist country. According to the di-
vision of the medical Ātreya-Sanhitā one of the three cli-
mates of India--see besides {#जाङ्गल#} and {#साधारण;#} it is
defined in Wise's Hindu system of Medicine as having much
water on its surface, being intersected by rivers and irregular
in its surface, with high mountains and tall trees; the air
being there cool and the wind temperate; abounding in
grass, water flowers, geese, ducks, cranes, fish, serpents &c.,
unhealthy and its inhabitants being fat, indolent and weak.
<sup>2</sup> (ved.) A jar ({#कलश#}). <sup>3</sup> The name of a country (mentioned
f. i. amongst those conquered by Rudradāman, one of the
Sinha-kings).
<div n="P">2. Tatpur. m. ({#-पः#}) <sup>1</sup> A buffalo. [<sup>2</sup> Any animal living
in the water or on shore. <sup>3</sup> The francoline partridge ({#ति-#}
{#त्तिरक#}). <sup>4</sup> An elephant. <sup>5</sup> A frog ({#प्लव#}). <sup>6</sup> Any shelled
animal which lives in the water. <sup>7</sup> An amphibious animal.
<sup>8</sup> A fish. (The last seven meanings are given on the authority
of several medical authors.)] <sup>9</sup> A proper name, an abbre-
viation of {#अनूपसिंह#} q. v. See {#अनूपविलास#}. E. {#अनु#} and
{#अप्,#} changed, according to Pāṇini, to {#ऊप्,#} samāsānta aff.
{#अ#} (the affix being the same in the Tatpur. and the Bahuvr.,
according to the Kāśikā), but as regards the change of the
vowel, it is more probable that {#अ#} of {#अप्#} has got lost and
the preceding vowel lengthened by way of compensation,
analogously to {#समीप, प्रतीप, द्वीप, वीप#} &c. In {#दर्भानूप#}
q. v. the {#न्#} is not changed to {#ण्#}.
<div n="P">II. Tatpur. m. ({#-पः#}) (ved.) Throwing or effusing in re-
[Page110-b+ 56]
gular succession or according to (scil. one's functions); an
epithet of the three divinities Parjanya, Vāyu and Āditya
‘who effuse on the earth (i. e. produce there) rain, cold and
heat successively or according to their functions’ (accord.
to Yāska and Sāyaṇa). E. {#वप्#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#अच्(?),#}
but it is better perhaps to assume that this {#अनूप#} means
originally ‘favourable, propitious’ and comes from {#अनु#} and
{#अप्,#} kṛt aff. {#अच्#}. For the latter etym. see the Preface.
