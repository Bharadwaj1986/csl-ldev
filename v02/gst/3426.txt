{#अनुष्टुभ्#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-ष्टुप्#}) <sup>1</sup> Speech, in general. <sup>2</sup> A name of
[Page106-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">Sarasvatī. <sup>3</sup> The name of a class of metres which consists
<div n="lb">of 32 syllables and, in the Vedas, is regulated by the number
<div n="lb">of syllables only, in classical poetry by number and quantity.
<div n="lb">In the Vedas the 32 syllables are distributed either in Te-
<div n="lb">trastichs of 8 syllables in each line, or in Triplets of either
<div n="lb">12 + 8 + 12 or 12 + 12 + 8 or 8 + 12 + 12 syllables. For the
<div n="lb">varieties of the Anuṣṭubh in the classical poetry see {#चित्र-#}
<div n="lb">{#पदा, विद्युन्माला, माणवक#} or {#माणवकाक्रीडा, हंसरुत, प्रमा-#}
<div n="lb">{#णिका#} or {#नगस्वरूपिणी#} or {#मतल्लिका, समानिका#} or {#मल्लिका,#}
<div n="lb">{#वितान, तुङ्गा, कमल, हंसपदी, मातङ्गी, रम्भा#} and the metre
<div n="lb">which is most in use but the quantity of which is not so in-
<div n="lb">variable as that of the named varieties viz. the {#श्लोक#}. In a
<div n="lb">vaidik hymn the Anuṣṭubh is represented as one of the
<div n="lb">primitive creations, that originated together with the moon;
<div n="lb">according to some Purāṇas it was created from the northern
<div n="lb">mouth of the four-headed Brahman (m.) together with the
<div n="lb">Atharvaveda, a portion of the Sāmaveda and some hymns
<div n="lb">as well as the Āptoryāma portion of the Jyotiṣṭoma sacri-
<div n="lb">fice; accord. to another Purāṇa from the tendons of Brahman.
<div n="lb">(The Kāsikā considers the vaidik {#अनुष्ट्या#} equivalent to the
<div n="lb">classical instrum. {#अनुष्टुभा;#} but {#अनुष्ट्या#} is probably an er-
<div n="lb">roneous reading for {#अनुष्ट्या#} q. v.) E. {#स्तुभ्#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt
<div n="lb">aff. {#क्विप्,#} so called according to the Nirukta ‘because it
<div n="lb">follows in praise ({#अनुष्टोभति#}) with its fourth Pāda the Gā-
<div n="lb">yatrī metre which consists only of three Pādas or stanzas’.
