{#अतित्यद्#}¦ Tatpur. Beyond that. E. {#अति#} (sc. {#क्रान्त#}) and {#त्यद्#}
(in the sense of the accusative). This word seems to be
only one of grammatical coinage, to show that the declen-
sion of {#त्यद्#} in compositions like these is like that of other
nouns ending in {#द्#} and not that of the pronominal theme
{#त्यद्;#} i. e. {#अतित्यद्, अतित्यदौ#} &c. (instead of {#अतिस्यः,#}
{#अतित्यौ#} &c.).
