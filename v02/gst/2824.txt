I. {#अनु#}¦ ind. (see {#निपात, उपसर्ग, गति, कर्मप्रवचनीय#}). A
particle implying the notion of ‘after’ in its literal and
metaphorical acceptations; it is used either as a separable
preposition or as a prefix to verbs, but, in the latter ca-
pacity, in the Vedas and in archaic passages of the epic
literature, also detached from the verb, very much in the
same manner as German prepositions when connected with
verbs; in the Vedas it is sometimes also used adverbially.
With nouns it may form Avyayībh., Tatpur. and Bahuvr.
compounds. It means:
