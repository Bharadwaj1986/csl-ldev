<L>4316<pc>146-b<k1>अन्या<k2>अन्या
{#अन्या#}.¦ The feminine of {#अन्य#} ‘other, different’ &c. q. v. This
word deserves notice only from the circumstance that it oc-
curs in some vaidik passages with the udātta accent on the
first syllable, instead of having this accent on the last syllable.
[Sāyaṇa is not the author of the meaning ‘never drying-up’
and of an etym. ‘{#अ#} and {#न्या,#} contracted of {#नि-या#}’ which have
been lent to this word by a new kind of vaidik exegesis.]
