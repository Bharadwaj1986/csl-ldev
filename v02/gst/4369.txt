{#अन्योन्यवृत्ति#}¦ Bahuvr. m. ({#-त्तिः#}) (In the Sāṅkhya philosophy.)
One calling the other into action, reciprocally causing each
other to act; a condition of the three {#गुण#} or qualities {#सत्त्व,#}
{#रजस्#} and {#तमस्#} qq. vv.; i. e. ‘one being or acting in the
other; as a handsome and well behaved woman is at the
same time a source of delight to every one else and one of
misery to the other wives of her husband, as well as one
of bewilderment to enamoured damsels, in the same manner
{%sattwa%} calls into existence {%rajas%} and {%tamas%} &c.’, other similes
being used to illustrate that {%rajas%} causes the action of {%sattwa%}
and {%tamas,%} and {%tamas%} that of {%sattwa%} and {%rajas.%} (Vāchaspati
does not recognise this condition of the three qualities;
see {#अन्योन्यजनन#}.) E. {#अन्योन्य#} and {#वृत्ति#}.
