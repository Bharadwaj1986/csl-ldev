{#अनुवेध#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-धः#}). The same as {#अनुव्याध#} q. v. E. In
<div n="lb">following the native lexicographical etym. of {#वेध,#} this word
<div n="lb">would come from {#विध्#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#घञ्,#} the radical
<div n="lb">{#विध्#} assuming in this derivative the meaning of {#व्यध्;#} it will
<div n="lb">appear however that the form {#वेध#} in the meaning of {#व्यध,#}
<div n="lb">and {#अनुवेध#} in that of {#अनुव्याध#} are objectionable, from a
<div n="lb">gramm. point of view, since {#विध्#} does not occur otherwise
<div n="lb">in the meaning “to pierce” and {#वेध#} is not mentioned by
<div n="lb">the best gramm. authorities as a derivative of either {#विध्#}
<div n="lb">or {#व्यध्#}.
