{#अनुवेध#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-धः#}). The same as {#अनुव्याध#} q. v. E. In
following the native lexicographical etym. of {#वेध,#} this word
would come from {#विध्#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#घञ्,#} the radical
{#विध्#} assuming in this derivative the meaning of {#व्यध्;#} it will
appear however that the form {#वेध#} in the meaning of {#व्यध,#}
and {#अनुवेध#} in that of {#अनुव्याध#} are objectionable, from a
gramm. point of view, since {#विध्#} does not occur otherwise
in the meaning “to pierce” and {#वेध#} is not mentioned by
the best gramm. authorities as a derivative of either {#विध्#}
or {#व्यध्#}.
