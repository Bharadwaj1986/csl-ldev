{#अन्त्यपद#}¦ Karmadh. n. ({#-दम्#}) (In Arithmetic.) The last or
greatest root in the affected square; also called {#अन्त्यमूल,#}

{#कनिष्ठपद#} or {#कनिष्ठमूल#} ‘the least or first root’. These terms
are thus explained after Brahmagupta by Colebrooke; ‘the
[Page130-a+ 56]
least or first root: that quantity of which the square multi-
plied by the given multiplicator and having the given ad-
dend added, or subtrahend subtracted, is capable of af-
fording an exact square root; the greatest or last root:
the square root which is extracted from the quantity so
operated upon’. E. {#अन्त्य#} and {#पद#}.
