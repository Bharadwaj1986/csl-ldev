{#अनुवाद#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-दः#}) <sup>1</sup> Reference or referring to what
has been previously said, not in the way of a mere repetition
or tautology, but in that of explanation, detailed comment
or emphasis; explanatory and corroborative reference, ex-
planation; e. g. {#भूपरिधिमानानुवादः#} ‘a detailed explanation
with reference to the measure of the earth's circumference
(mentioned before in the Golādhyāya)’; or, in Manu 2. 53.
the words {#खानि संस्पृशेत्#} are an {#अनुवाद#} to {#निवेद्य#} &c. 2. 51.,
because they give a detailed illustration of the general in-
junction contained in the latter verse. If a word is repeated
or an expression used which would seem superfluous, be-
cause not conveying a new notion, such repeated word or
[Page103-a+ 56]
such expression is {#अनुवाद,#} provided a certain purpose be
connected with it, otherwise it would be simply {#पुनरुक्त#} or
a meaningless tautology, e. g. {#घटो घटः#} or {#घटः कलसः#} ‘a
jar is a jar’ would be a {#पुनरुक्त;#} but the repetition of {#पश्येत्#}
in Yājnav. 2. 1. from 1. 359. is an {#अनुवादः#} because it points
to the connexion between both passages and to the detail
which is to follow as an illustration of 1. 359.; or in Manu
1. 72. {#परिसंख्यया#} might be taken as an {#अनुवाद#} to {#सहस्रं,#}
because it imparts greater emphasis to the bare numeral.
<sup>2</sup> In the ritual literature {#अनुवाद#} designates those passages
of the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Vedas, which point to an
injunction given before ({#विधि#} q. v.) and illustrate it by the
way of comment, or by entering into greater detail, or by
adding supplementary rules, but without stating the purpose
of the injunction itself as the latter would be the object of
the {#अर्थवाद#} (q. v.); the {#अनुवाद#} being accessory, therefore,
to the {#विधि#} portion of the Brāhmaṇa and precluded from
giving independent regulations, the supplementary rites they
contain are not considered of equal weight and as absolute
as those of the {#विधि;#} there exists however sometimes a
difficulty to decide whether a passage of the Brāhmaṇas is
{#विधि#} or {#अनुवाद,#} or in other words whether its injunctions
are absolute or not, as appears from the discussion of the
Mīmānsists. (The Nyāya, supported by the commentaries
on the Mīmānsā, distribute the text of the Brāhmaṇa under
the three heads of {#विधि, अनुवाद#} and {#अर्थवाद#} qq. vv.; a
later division makes {#अनुवाद#} one of the three categories
of the {#अर्थवाद#}.) <sup>3</sup> Report, e. g. {#कुत्सितार्थानुवादः#}. <sup>4</sup> Abuse,
reviling (? this meaning is given by several dictionaries on
the authority of the Śabdaratnāvalī, but, to judge from
the Mss. at my disposal, it would seem to proceed from
another reading or from a misunderstanding of the passage
of this work which contains the synonymes of ‘rumour’:
{#यथार्थानिश्चिता वार्त्ता भवेत्सर्वजनात्मिका । कुत्सितार्थानुवादो#}
{#वा किंवदन्ती जनश्रुतिः ॥;#} the same might be said of the
meanings ‘abusive reply’ and ‘divulging another's misdeeds’
which occur also in some dictionaries). E. {#वद्#} with {#अनु,#}
kṛt aff. {#घञ्#} or {#अनु#} and {#वाद#}.
