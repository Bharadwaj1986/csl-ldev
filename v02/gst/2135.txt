{#अध्वन्#}¦ m. ({#-ध्वा#}) <sup>1</sup> Sky, atmosphere (only in the Vedas).
<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> A road. <sup>3</sup> Time. <sup>4</sup> A place (perhaps, a place where four
<div n="lb">roads meet). <sup>5</sup> A branch or school of the Vedas or sacred
<div n="lb">literature.--In some Tatpurusha compounds the former
<div n="lb">part of which is an {#उपसर्ग#} (q. v.), this word occurs in the
<div n="lb">form of {#अध्व;#} i. e. the compound assumes the samāsānta
<div n="lb">aff. {#अच्;#} e. g. {#प्राध्व, निरध्व, प्रत्यध्व#}.--(The two last
<div n="lb">meanings of this word are rather unsettled through the
<div n="lb">variety of readings in the native dictionaries from which
<div n="lb">they are taken; some read {#अध्वा…संस्थाने स्यादवस्कन्धे,#}
[Page063-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">others {#संस्थाने साश्रवस्कन्धे;#} the best reading, however, that
<div n="lb">which has been adopted in the present translation, seems
<div n="lb">to be this: {#संस्थाने शास्त्रवत्स्कन्धे#}.) E. doubtful; according
<div n="lb">to some, {#अद्,#} uṇ. aff. {#क्वनिप्,#} with {#ध्#} substituted for {#द्#}
<div n="lb">‘because it eats up the strength of the traveller’; or ac-
<div n="lb">cording to others, {#अत्,#} uṇ. aff. {#क्वनिप्,#} with {#ध्#} instead of {#त्#}.
