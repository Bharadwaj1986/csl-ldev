{#अध्वन्#}¦ m. ({#-ध्वा#}) <sup>1</sup> Sky, atmosphere (only in the Vedas).
<sup>2</sup> A road. <sup>3</sup> Time. <sup>4</sup> A place (perhaps, a place where four
roads meet). <sup>5</sup> A branch or school of the Vedas or sacred
literature.--In some Tatpurusha compounds the former
part of which is an {#उपसर्ग#} (q. v.), this word occurs in the
form of {#अध्व;#} i. e. the compound assumes the samāsānta
aff. {#अच्;#} e. g. {#प्राध्व, निरध्व, प्रत्यध्व#}.--(The two last
meanings of this word are rather unsettled through the
variety of readings in the native dictionaries from which
they are taken; some read {#अध्वा…संस्थाने स्यादवस्कन्धे,#}
[Page063-b+ 56]
others {#संस्थाने साश्रवस्कन्धे;#} the best reading, however, that
which has been adopted in the present translation, seems
to be this: {#संस्थाने शास्त्रवत्स्कन्धे#}.) E. doubtful; according
to some, {#अद्,#} uṇ. aff. {#क्वनिप्,#} with {#ध्#} substituted for {#द्#}
‘because it eats up the strength of the traveller’; or ac-
cording to others, {#अत्,#} uṇ. aff. {#क्वनिप्,#} with {#ध्#} instead of {#त्#}.
