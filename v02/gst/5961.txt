{#अभिचार#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-रः#}) Incantation, employment of charms
or spells for a malevolent purpose.--The {%Shaḍvinśa-Brā-%}
{%hmaṇa%} names as such purposes: killing an enemy and de-
priving him of his cattle or property; it gives an account
of four sacrifices which are performed for the attainment
of these objects, (see {#श्येन, त्रिवृदग्निष्टोम, संदंश#} and {#वज्र#})
and describes the manner in which the mantras are to be
recited at these sacrifices; (see {#विष्टुति#}).--The {%Tantrasāra%}
(as quoted by {%Rādhākāntad.%}) names six purposes of incan-
tation, viz. causing death ({#मारण#}), mental aberration ({#मो-#}
{#हन#}), stoppage of the bodily functions ({#स्तम्भन#}), hatred ({#वि-#}
{#द्वेषण#}), ruin ({#उच्चाटन#}) and submission ({#वशीकरण#}). [Comp.
e. g. also the following passage from the {%Skanda-Purāṇa:%}
{#कुशैर्वा दूर्वया देवि आसने शुभ्रकम्बले । उपविश्य ततो देवि#}
{#जपेदेकाग्रमानसः#} (scil. {#गुरुगीताम्#}) {#। शुक्लासने वै शान्त्यर्थे#}
{#ऽवश्ये रक्तासनं प्रिये । अभिचारे कृष्णवर्णं पीतवर्णं धनागमे ।#}
{#उत्तरे शान्तिजाप्यस्यावश्ये पूर्वमुखोदितम् । दक्षिणे मारणं#}
{#प्रोक्तं स्तम्भने पश्चिमे मुखम् । मोहनं सर्वभूतानां बन्धमोक्षकरं#}
{#परम् । देवभूपप्रियकरं राजानं वशमानयेत्#} &c.]--{%Suśruta%}
speaks of a variety of fever caused by incantation (see {#अ-#}
{#भिचारज्वर#} and comp. {#अभिषङ्गज्वर#}), the symptoms of
which are, according to the {%Nighaṇṭa Prakāśa,%} thirst,
mental aberration, abscesses, delirium, fainting, anguish,
excessive heat &c.--{%Manu%} (likewise Viṣṇu &c.) when
speaking of incantations (9. 290.) makes a distinction between
{#अभिचार, मूलकर्मन्#} and various {#कृत्या;#} the former com-
prises, according to {%Medhātithi%} and {%Kullūka%} as well incan-
tations founded on vaidik writings ({#वैदिक#} or {#शास्त्रीय,#}
such as the Śyena &c.), as those founded on vulgar super-
stition ({#लौकिक,#} such as taking the dust of the feet, digging
in needles--{#सूचीनिखनन#} in the E. I. H. Mss. of {%Medh.%} being
apparently a better reading than {#मूलनिखनन#} in the present edd.
of {%Kull.%}--&c.) for the purpose of {%causing death;%} {#मूलकर्मन्#} is,
according to both comm., {%subduing%} a person by means of
mantras, drugs &c. ({%Kull.:%} {#मन्त्रौषधादिना;#} {%Medh.:%} {#मन्त्रा-#}
{#दिक्रियया#}); the {#कृत्या#} are, according to {%Kullūka,%} incantations
for the sake of {%causing ruin, making sick%} &c., according to
{%Medh.,%} for the sake of {%causing ruin, animosity between friends%}
{%or relatives, working wonders%} &c. ({#उच्चाटनसुहृद्बन्धुकलहविचि-#}
{#त्रीकरणादिहेतवः#}).--{%Manu%} fines a person who employs
charms two hundred Paṇas (9. 290.), classes in another pas-
sage {#अभिचार#} and {#मूलकर्मन्#} amongst the Upapātaka (11. 63.)
and makes the expiation of an {#अभिचार#} depend on the per-
formance, thrice repeated, of the penance called Kṛchchhra
(11. 197.). But as these clauses would jar apparently with
the vaidik texts which impliedly sanction the employment
of charms by regulating the sacrifices Śyena &c. performed
for incantatory purposes, {%Kullūka%} qualifies the definition of
Manu 11. 63. by commenting that {#अभिचार#} is an {#उपपातक,#} if
it causes the death of an {%innocent%} or {%unoffending%} person ({#श्येना-#}
{#दियज्ञेनानपराधस्य मारणम्#}), while {%Medhātithi%} seems merely
[Page240-b+ 56]
to lay stress on the fact of {%death%} itself (although the death
be that of an enemy) and perhaps too on the condition of
death being caused by a {%vaidik%} kind of incantation ({%Medh.%}
to 11. 63.: {#अभिचारो वैदिकेन शापादिना मन्त्रप्रयोगेण श्ये-#}
{#नादियागेन वा शत्रुमारणम्,#} or to 11. 197.: {#वैदिकेन जपहो-#}
{#मादिना शत्रोर्मारणमभिचारः#}); for the same reason, pro-
bably, both comm. agree in giving to the penalty clause
(9. 290) the additional sense: ‘if the incantation does {%not%}
{%cause death%}’, and qualify, in the clause 11. 197., the incan-
tation as one ‘directed against a person who ought not to have
been brought under the spell (i. e. an innocent or unoffending
person)’; some however, as results from {%Medh.'%}s discussion
on the latter verse, give it a different bearing, for they supply
the preceding word {#याजन#} at {#अभिचार#} and subject thus to the
penance Kṛchchhra, not the {#यजमान#} or the person who
institutes an incantatory sacrifice, but the {#ऋत्विज्#} or the
priest who performs for him such a sacrifice. But in spite
of these efforts of the commentators to establish a harmony
between Manu and the Veda, it will seem that another
possibility alluded to by {%Medhātithi%} is more plausible, viz.
that Manu did not attach any scriptural authority to such
voluntary rites, as the incantatory sacrifices, and, there-
fore, did not consider himself at variance with the Veda,
when he interdicted incantations in an unqualified manner;
({%Medhātithi:%} {#ननु च काम्यान्यपि निषिद्धानि । कामात्मता न प्रश-#}
{#स्तेति । यत्तस्य विषयः । स तत्रैव व्याख्यातः#}). E. {#चर्#} with
{#अभि,#} kṛt aff. {#घञ्#}.
