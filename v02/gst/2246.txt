{#अननुभाषण#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-णम्#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
Not repeating the argument for discussion, i. e. a tacit
agreement with it or assent to the assertion of the person
[Page067-b+ 56]
who has proposed it; viz. if, after the argument for dis-
cussion has been announced, it has not been repeated by
any one--the sign of taking it up--the proposer has to
proclaim it three times; if then it does not meet with the
anubhāṣana, it is considered as proved or as accepted as
such. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#अनुभाषण#}.
