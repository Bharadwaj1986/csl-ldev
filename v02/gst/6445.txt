<div n="P">{%A.%} INAUGURATION OF A KING. This ceremony is either
<div n="lb">part of a Rājasūya, and performed by a king at the end
<div n="lb">of this sacrifice--when it is called {#पुनरभिषेक#} or {%second%}
<div n="lb">{%inauguration,%} since the {%Abhisheka%} or first inauguration of a
<div n="lb">king must have taken place previously--; or it is not
<div n="lb">part of a sacrifice and occurs at a king's accession to the
<div n="lb">throne--then it is the {#अभिषेक#} proper. [Both ceremonies
<div n="lb">are described in the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,%} first the {%Punar-%}
<div n="lb">{%abhisheka,%} then the {%Abhisheka;%} in conformity with this au-
<div n="lb">thority the same order has been preserved in the following
<div n="lb">account, since the {%Abhisheka%} ceremony refers in many re-
<div n="lb">spects to that of the {%Punarabhisheka.%}]
<div n="P">{%a.%} The {%Punarabhisheka%} is performed by a king at the
<div n="lb">end of a {%Rājasūya,%} after he has undergone preliminary
<div n="lb">purification ({#दीक्षा#}), when he has risen from the {%Avabhṛtha%}
<div n="lb">ceremonies, has performed the {%Anūbandhya%} sacrifice and
<div n="lb">completed the final rite, the {%Udavasanīyā.%} There must have
<div n="lb">been prepared for the occasion a throne-seat ({#आसन्दी#}) of
<div n="lb">the wood of the {%Udumbara%} (ficus glomerata), resting on
<div n="lb">four legs a span ({#प्रादेश#}) high, with boards placed on
<div n="lb">them ({#शीर्षण्य;#} see below page 277{%b,%} line 6 ff.) and side boards
<div n="lb">({#अनूच्य;#} see ibid.) of the dimension of a cubit (or two spans;
<div n="lb">{#अरत्नि,#} {%Sāyaṇa:%} {#प्रादेशद्वयमरत्निः#}); the whole well fastened
<div n="lb">together with a texture made of cords of {%Munja%} grass
<div n="lb">(Saccharum munja), a tiger skin which is placed on the
<div n="lb">seat with the hairs upwards and the neck to the east, a
<div n="lb">large (four cornered) ladle ({#चमसः;#} {%Sāy.%} at a later occa-
<div n="lb">sion: = {#चतुष्कोणो दण्डयुक्तः पात्रविशेषः#}) of {%Udumbara%} wood
<div n="lb">and a branch of the same; in the ladle have been put eight
<div n="lb">things: curd ({#दधि#}), honey ({#मधु#}), clarified butter ({#सर्पिस्#}),
<div n="lb">water proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen
<div n="lb">down ({#आतपवर्ष्या आपः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#आतपयुक्तवर्षभवाः#}); blades
<div n="lb">of {%Syāma%} grass ({#शष्याणि;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#श्यामतृणानि#}), sprouts
<div n="lb">({#तोक्मानि;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#अङ्कुराणि#}), spirituous liquor ({#सुरा#}) and
<div n="lb">{%Dūb%} grass ({#दूर्वा,#} Panicum dactylon). (To prepare a site
<div n="lb">for the throne three lines have been drawn on a place of
<div n="lb">sacrifice with the sacrificial implement called {%Sphya%} (q. v.),
<div n="lb">one southwards, another westwards and a third north-
<div n="lb">wards); the one to the south is that on which the throne
<div n="lb">is to be placed with its front towards the east, so that the two
[Page275-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">feet to the north come to stand within the Vedi or sacri-
<div n="lb">ficial ground and the two to the south without; this latter
<div n="lb">spot occupied by the throne-seat is called {%Śrī;%} (as a type
<div n="lb">of happiness or prosperity; {%Sāy.:%} {#श्रीर्वै संपद्रूपैव#}). The
<div n="lb">place within the Vedi being small, but that without being
<div n="lb">illimited, this position of the throne indicates that the sacri-
<div n="lb">ficer may obtain definite and indefinite wishes within and
<div n="lb">without the Vedi. The tiger skin is the type of increase
<div n="lb">of Kshatriya power, for the tiger is the Kshatriya or hero
<div n="lb">of the wild beasts; the Udumbara wood of the throne,
<div n="lb">ladle and branch is the type of essential juice ({#ऊर्ज्#} {%Sāy.:%}
<div n="lb">= {#क्षीरादिरसः#}) and of food (which the sacrificer is sup-
<div n="lb">posed to acquire by this symbol); curd, honey and clari-
<div n="lb">fied butter typify the essence of water and plants; (curd and
<div n="lb">butter, as {%Sāyaṇa%} observes, because they originate in grass
<div n="lb">and water which are the food of cattle; honey, because it
<div n="lb">originates in the juice of plants collected by bees); water pro-
<div n="lb">ceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen down
<div n="lb">typifies (on account of the sunshine) lustre (or energy; {#तेजस्#})
<div n="lb">and (rain being the consequence of oblations to the gods)
<div n="lb">holiness ({#ब्रह्मवर्चसम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#श्रुताध्ययनसंपत्तिः#}); grass
<div n="lb">and sprouts typify food ({#इरा;#} they being the food of cattle),
<div n="lb">hence prosperity ({#पुष्टि,#} increase) and progency ({#प्रजा#}); spi-
<div n="lb">rituous liquor is the type of a Kshatriya's power (on ac-
<div n="lb">count of its fierceness or hotness; {%Sāy.:%} {#सुरया क्षत्रियस्यैव#}
<div n="lb">{#मदयोगात्क्षत्ररूपत्वम्#}) and of the essence of food (or rice,
<div n="lb">liquor being made of rice; comp. {#अन्नरस; अन्नस्य रसः;#} {%Sāy.:%}
<div n="lb">{#अन्नजन्यत्वादन्नरसत्वम्#}); {%Dūb%} grass (being the Kshatriya of
<div n="lb">the plants and firmly established in the soil with its many
<div n="lb">roots) is the type of Kshatriya-power and of a firmly esta-
<div n="lb">blished rule.--The principal features of the ceremony
<div n="lb">itself are the following. The king who performs the sacrifice
<div n="lb">kneels down at the back part of the throne-seat with his
<div n="lb">face to the east and his right knee touching the ground
<div n="lb">(while his left knee remains upwards); he then touches
<div n="lb">with his hands the throne-seat and invites the gods to
<div n="lb">ascend it together with various metres: {%Agni%} with the metre
<div n="lb">Gāyatrī, {%Savitṛ%} with the Uṣṇih, {%Soma%} with the Anu-
<div n="lb">ṣṭubh, {%Bṛhaspati%} with the Bṛhatī, {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%}
<div n="lb">with the Pankti, {%Indra%} with the Triṣṭubh, the {%Viśve-%}
<div n="lb">{%Devās%} with the Jagatī, for the purpose of obtaining kingly
<div n="lb">power ({#राज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#देशाधिपत्यम्#}), righteous govern-
<div n="lb">ment ({#साम्राज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#धर्मेण पालनम्#}), increase of en-
<div n="lb">joyment ({#भौज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#भोगसमृद्धिः#}), independent rule
<div n="lb">({#स्वाराज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#अपराधीनत्वम्#}), attainment of more
<div n="lb">distinguished qualities than those possessed by other kings
<div n="lb">({#वैराज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#इतरेभ्यो भूपतिभ्यो वैशिष्ट्यम्#}), coming
<div n="lb">(after death) into the world of Brahman ({#पारमेष्ठ्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%}
<div n="lb">{#एतदुक्तमैहिकम्#}--i. e. what precedes--{#अथामुष्मिकमुच्यते ।#}
<div n="lb">{#पारमेष्ठ्यं प्रजापतिलोकप्राप्तिः#}) and obtaining there dominion
<div n="lb">({#राज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#तत्र राज्यमैश्वर्यम्#}), a mighty rule ({#माहा-#}
<div n="lb">{#राज्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#तत्रत्येभ्य इतरेभ्य आधिक्यम्#}), mastership
<div n="lb">({#आधिपत्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#तानितरान्प्रति स्वामित्वम्#}), indepen-
<div n="lb">dence ({#स्वावश्यम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#अपारतन्त्यम्#}) and a long resi-
<div n="lb">dence there ({#आतिष्ठम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#चिरकालवासित्वम्#}). [Of the
<div n="lb">metres mentioned before each following metre has four
[Page276-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">syllables more than each preceding one; the invitation itself
<div n="lb">which is addressed to the gods is founded on the {%Ṛgv.%}
<div n="lb">10. 130. 4.; and the company of the gods is solicited by the king
<div n="lb">in order to ensure the attainment of what was before unat-
<div n="lb">tained by him ({#योगः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#अप्राप्तस्य लाभस्य प्राप्तिः#}) and
<div n="lb">the preservation of what he has obtained ({#क्षेमः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#प्रा-#}
<div n="lb">{#प्तस्य वस्तुनो रक्षणम्#}).] The gods have arrived and the king
<div n="lb">now ascends himself the throne-seat, first with his right
<div n="lb">and then with his left knee.--The next ceremony is the
<div n="lb">propitiation of the liquid in the ladle, which is performed
<div n="lb">by the priest who will pour it over the king, by reciting
<div n="lb">the hymn: ‘waters behold me with a favourable eye, with
<div n="lb">a favourable body touch my skin; all fires, for they reside
<div n="lb">in water, I invoke on your account; do you produce in me
<div n="lb">beauty, bodily strength and energy’; and by the king re-
<div n="lb">peating these words after him. If this propitiation did not
<div n="lb">take place, the liquid would destroy the vigour of the king.
<div n="lb">(The quoted verse occurs, though with some variations, in
<div n="lb">the {%Atharvav.%} 10. 1. 12 and 13.) After this, the priest covers
<div n="lb">the head of the king with the {%Udumbara%}-branch and pours
<div n="lb">the liquid over him while reciting the following three {%Ṛg-%}
<div n="lb">{%veda%}-verses: ‘These waters are most propitious, they have
<div n="lb">healing power to free from all disease ({%Sāy.%} ‘poverty and
<div n="lb">other diseases’: {#दारिद्र्यादिरोगस्य भेषजीः#}); they are the
<div n="lb">augmenters of kingly power, and (therefore) its supporters;
<div n="lb">they are immortal.’ ‘With which Prajāpati sprinkled In-
<div n="lb">dra, the king Soma and Manu, with these I sprinkle thee,
<div n="lb">that thou becomest king of kings in this world.’ ‘The
<div n="lb">queen, thy mother, bore thee to be great amongst the
<div n="lb">great, and a righteous ruler over men; an auspicious mother
<div n="lb">bore thee’; and this {%Yajurveda%}-verse: ‘The divine Savitṛ has
<div n="lb">given his consent, therefore I pour (this liquid) over thee
<div n="lb">with the arms of the Aśvins ({%Sāyaṇa:%} not with my own),
<div n="lb">with the hands of Pūṣan, with the beauty of Agni ({#तेजस्;#}
<div n="lb">{%Sāy.:%} = {#शारीरकान्तिः#}), with the radiance of Sūrya ({#वर्चस्;#}
<div n="lb">{%Sāy.:%} = {#वाह्यप्रकाशः#}) and with the (sharp) senses of Indra
<div n="lb">({#इन्द्रियम्;#} {%Sāy.%} ‘with the sharpness of the eyes’ &c.: =
<div n="lb">{#चक्षुरादिपाटवम्#}), for the sake of strength ({#बलम्#}), prospe-
<div n="lb">rity ({#श्रीः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#हस्त्यश्वादिसंपद्#}), glory and increase of
<div n="lb">food ({#अन्नम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#अन्नसमृद्धिः#})’. If the priest wishes
<div n="lb">that the king may enjoy good health (lit. may eat food),
<div n="lb">he must, after these verses, utter the sacred word {%Bhūr!%}
<div n="lb">(earth!). If he wishes that the king may enjoy good health
<div n="lb">and live to see a son and a grandson ({#द्विपुरुष#}) he must
<div n="lb">utter the sacred words: {%Bhūr! Bhuvas!%} (earth! intermediate
<div n="lb">region between earth and sun!), and if he wishes him to
<div n="lb">enjoy good health and live to see three generations ({#त्रि-#}
<div n="lb">{#पुरुष#}), or if he wishes him to remain unrivalled, he must
<div n="lb">utter the sacred words: {%Bhūr! Bhuvas! Swar!%} (earth! inter-
<div n="lb">mediate region! heaven!). [The {%text%} of the {%Aitar. Br.%} men-
<div n="lb">tions on this occasion that some authorities object to the
<div n="lb">enunciation of the latter words; but it quotes, too, the
<div n="lb">opinion of the Ṛṣi {%Satyakāma,%} the son of {%Jābālā,%} who
<div n="lb">maintains that a king who is not inaugurated with these
<div n="lb">{%Vyāhṛtis%} or sacred words, will die before the due term of
<div n="lb">his life, and that of {%Uddālaka,%} the son of {%Aruṇa,%} who says
[Page276-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">that a king who is inaugurated with these words, will ar-
<div n="lb">rive at the full term of his life and conquer his enemies.]
<div n="lb">Since at the pouring of the liquid the essence of water,
<div n="lb">holiness and the other boons which are conferred on the
<div n="lb">king by the ingredients placed in the ladle, are shed and
<div n="lb">go away, as it were, from the king, he must, to secure
<div n="lb">them, before the liquid is poured over him, make two
<div n="lb">oblations (while uttering the words: {#ब्रह्म प्रपद्ये स्वाहा क्षत्रं#}
<div n="lb">{#प्रपद्ये स्वाहा#} i. e. I am obtaining holiness, Svāhā! I am
<div n="lb">obtaining power, Svāhā!). After the liquid has been
<div n="lb">poured over the king, the priest places in his hand a
<div n="lb">goblet of spirituous liquor and recites the following verse
<div n="lb">({%Ṛgv.%} 9. 1. 1. = {%Sāmav.%} 2. 39. = {%Vājas.%} 26. 25.): ‘Soma with
<div n="lb">thy most sweet exhilarating drops purify (this sacrificer),
<div n="lb">for thou wast poured out for Indra to drink.’ Then he
<div n="lb">recites and makes the king repeat after him the following
<div n="lb">invocation: ‘(Soma and spirituous liquor), because a se-
<div n="lb">parate residence has been allotted to you by the gods,
<div n="lb">therefore do not combine in the lofty æther; liquor, thou
<div n="lb">art powerful, but thou, Soma, art a king; do not harm him
<div n="lb">(the king), when you enter into your several receptacles
<div n="lb">(i. e. into his stomach).’ [This verse occurs with some
<div n="lb">variations in the {%Vājas.%} 19. 7.] By the recital of these verses
<div n="lb">spirituous liquor and Soma become identified; compare
<div n="lb">page 279{%a,%} line 52ff. Having drunk the king then presents
<div n="lb">the rest to a man whom he considers his friend, for drink-
<div n="lb">ing out of the same cup is the mutual practice of friends.
<div n="lb">He then places the Udumbara branch on the ground as a
<div n="lb">symbol of essential juice ({#ऊर्ज्#}) and food, and prepares
<div n="lb">himself for descending from the throne-seat; but while he
<div n="lb">is still seated and puts his feet on the ground he says: ‘I
<div n="lb">firmly stand on heaven and earth, I firmly stand on ex-
<div n="lb">haled and inhaled air ({#प्राण#} and {#अपान#}), I firmly stand on
<div n="lb">day and night, I firmly stand on food and drink; on what
<div n="lb">is Brahmaṇa, on what is Kshatriya, on these three worlds
<div n="lb">stand I firmly.’ He then descends, sits down on the ground
<div n="lb">with his face towards the east, utters thrice the words
<div n="lb">‘adoration to what is Brāhmaṇa’ and offers a gift ({%Sāy.:%}
<div n="lb">a cow) to a Brāhmaṇa; the object of this gift is the at-
<div n="lb">tainment of victory in general ({#जितिः#}), of victory every-
<div n="lb">where ({#अभिजितिः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#अभितः सर्वेषु देशेषु जितिः#}); of
<div n="lb">victory over strong and weak enemies ({#विजितिः;#} {%Sāy.:%} =
<div n="lb">{#प्रबलदुर्बलशत्रूणां तारतम्येन विविधो जयः#}) and of complete
<div n="lb">victory ({#संजितिः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#शत्रुत्वराहित्याय सम्यग्जयः#}); and
<div n="lb">his threefold expression of adoration to what is a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">implies that a kingdom prospers and has valiant men when
<div n="lb">it is under the control of the Brāhmaṇas, and that a valiant
<div n="lb">son will be born to him. After this ceremony the king
<div n="lb">rises and puts fuel into the Āhavanīya fire while uttering
<div n="lb">the words: ‘(wood) thou art fuel, bestow on me sharpness
<div n="lb">of sense and strength of body’. Then he is going to take
<div n="lb">three steps to the east, north (and as {%Sāy.%} explains), to the
<div n="lb">north-cast, but previously to doing so points to the region,
<div n="lb">and addresses the step he is about to take with these words:
<div n="lb">‘thou subduest for me the regions; enable me therefore to
<div n="lb">adore the gods, and may attainment of my desires and preser-
[Page277-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">vation of what I have attained be granted to me; may there be
<div n="lb">no danger (or fear) to me’. [The injunctions which follow in
<div n="lb">the text of the {%Aitar. Br.%} are merely incidental and refer
<div n="lb">to the conduct of a king and the ceremonies he has to per-
<div n="lb">form, when his assistance in warfare is sought for by
<div n="lb">another king.] Upon this and having recited the {%Ṛgveda%}-
<div n="lb">verse (10. 131. 1.), with the purpose of freeing himself from
<div n="lb">enemies, he returns to his palace, when he will be without
<div n="lb">foes and peril and day by day increase in prosperity, au-
<div n="lb">thority and sovereignty. There he sits down by the do-
<div n="lb">mestic fire and the Adhwaryu priest makes for him, out
<div n="lb">of a goblet, four times three oblations with clarified butter
<div n="lb">to Indra while reciting the three {%Ṛgveda%}-verses 9. 110. 1-3.
<div n="lb">or {%Sāmav.%} 2. 714. 716. 715. [The recital of these verses takes
<div n="lb">place in a peculiar manner, called {#प्रपदम्,#} which consists
<div n="lb">in inserting between the syllables of some word in the
<div n="lb">second Pāda of either of these verses certain other words
<div n="lb">which are foreign to the text of the {%Ṛgv.%}-hymn, viz. the
<div n="lb">words {#भूर्ब्रह्म प्राणममृतं प्रपद्यतेऽयमसौ शर्म वर्माभयं स्वस्तये#}
<div n="lb">{#सह प्रजया सह पशुभिः#} between the second and third syl-
<div n="lb">lables of the word {#वृत्राणि#} in the second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9.
<div n="lb">110. 1.; the words {#भुवो ब्रह्म#} &c. {#…पशुभिः#} between the
<div n="lb">second and third syllables of the word {#समर्यराज्ये#} in the
<div n="lb">second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9. 110. 2.; and the words {#स्वर्ब्रह्म#} &c.
<div n="lb">{#…पशुभिः#} between the first and second syllables of the
<div n="lb">word {#शक्मना#} in the second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9. 110. 3.; the
<div n="lb">sense of these words is: ‘he (the king) seeks the protection
<div n="lb">of earth ({#भूर्;#} in the second verse…of {#भुवस्#} or the inter-
<div n="lb">mediate region; in the third of {#स्वर्#} or heaven), of the
<div n="lb">Veda, of life, of Amṛta; for the sake of his bliss grant
<div n="lb">him (o Indra) happiness, armour and safety with his
<div n="lb">children and his cattle’.] A king for whom these libations
<div n="lb">are made to Indra in the indicated manner becomes free
<div n="lb">from disease, cannot be injured by enemies, is exempt
<div n="lb">from poverty, everywhere protected against danger, and
<div n="lb">thus becomes victorious in all the quarters, and after death
<div n="lb">established in Indra's heaven.--At the end of the whole
<div n="lb">ceremony the king prays for increase in cows, horses and
<div n="lb">progeny and more especially to obtain a son who would
<div n="lb">be liberal towards the priests at his sacrifices and a power-
<div n="lb">ful protector of his subjects.--Priests who understand
<div n="lb">well how to perform the whole rite will raise the king to
<div n="lb">an exalted position; those on the contrary who are igno-
<div n="lb">rant of the manner in which it is to be performed, will
<div n="lb">bring him unto perdition. (As an instance of the efficacy
<div n="lb">of this part of the Rājasūya sacrifice when performed by
<div n="lb">priests who well understand their duties, the text of the {%Aitar.%}
<div n="lb">{%Br.%} quotes the instance of {%Janamejaya,%} the son of {%Parīkṣit.%})
<div n="P">{%b.%} The rites of the {%Abhisheka%} which is not part of a
<div n="lb">Rājasūya sacrifice, but a ceremony performed at a king's
<div n="lb">accession to the throne, are similar to, but not identical
<div n="lb">with, those of the {%Punarabhisheka;%} they are founded on
<div n="lb">the proceedings which took place when Indra was conse-
<div n="lb">crated by the gods as their supreme ruler, and which form
<div n="lb">the subject of the 38<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.%}
<div n="lb">It is there told that the throne-seat which served at Indra's
[Page277-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">inauguration was made of {%Ṛgveda%}-verses, its eight parts
<div n="lb">consisting of {%Sāmaveda%}-verses, viz. the two fore-legs of
<div n="lb">the {%Bṛhat%} and {%Rathantara,%} the two hind-legs of the {%Vai-%}
<div n="lb">{%rūpa%} and {%Vairāja,%} the two top boards of the {%Śākvara%} and
<div n="lb">{%Raivata,%} and the two side boards of the {%Naudhasa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kāleya.%} [In the corresponding passage of the {%Punarabhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%sheka, Sāyaṇa%} speaks of {%several%} {#शोर्षण्य#} and renders the word
<div n="lb">‘boards placed on the legs of the throne-seat’: {#तेषां पा-#}
<div n="lb">{#दानां शिरस्युपरिभागेऽवस्थितानि शीर्षण्यानि;#} in the pre-
<div n="lb">sent passage the text has the dual {#शीर्षण्ये#} which {%Sāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">explains as the board where the head of Indra and, by
<div n="lb">implication, as the board where his feet rest upon: {#आस-#}
<div n="lb">{#न्द्यां शयानस्येन्द्रस्य शिरोदेशस्थं फलकं शीर्षण्यम् । तच्च पाद-#}
<div n="lb">{#देशाविकृतस्य फलकस्याप्युपलक्षणम्;#} {%Sāyaṇa%} likewise speaks
<div n="lb">in his comm. on the first passage of several {#अनूच्य,#} while
<div n="lb">the text of the latter mentions distinctly two, viz. {#अनूच्ये;#}
<div n="lb">the former explanation of {#शीर्षण्य#} seems more natural, since
<div n="lb">the latter is at variance with the dimensions of the throne-
<div n="lb">seat stated before, but it is probably more correct to view
<div n="lb">the compound {#शीर्षण्यानूच्यानि#} which occurs in the chapter
<div n="lb">on the Punarabhisheka, as representing two duals]; of the
<div n="lb">threads of the texture which was to hold this structure to-
<div n="lb">gether, those that went lengthwise were made of {%Ṛgveda%}-
<div n="lb">and those that went crossways of {%Sāmaveda-,%} the intervals
<div n="lb">being {%Yajurveda%}-verses; the covering of the throne was
<div n="lb">(the goddess of) {%Glory,%} the pillow ({%Sāy.:%} where his head
<div n="lb">rested upon) {%Śrī%} (the goddess of Happiness). {%Savītṛ%} and
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} supported the fore-legs, {%Vāyu%} and {%Pūṣan%} the
<div n="lb">hind-legs, {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%} the two top boards and the
<div n="lb">two {%Aśvins%} the two side boards of the throne-seat, while
<div n="lb">Indra ascended it after having invited the {%Vasus%} to take
<div n="lb">place on it with the metre Gāyatrī, the Stoma (q. v.) Tri-
<div n="lb">vṛt and the Sāman (q. v.) Rathantara for the sake of ob-
<div n="lb">taining righteous government ({#साम्राज्य#}), the {%Rudras%} for
<div n="lb">increase of enjoyment ({#भौज्य#}), the {%Adityas%} for independent
<div n="lb">rule ({#स्वाराज्य#}), the {%Viśve-Devas%} for the attainment of dis-
<div n="lb">tinguished qualities ({#वैराज्य#}), the {%Sādhyas%} and {%Āptyas%} for
<div n="lb">dominion ({#राज्य#}), the {%Maruts%} and {%Āṅgirasas%} for coming into
<div n="lb">the world of Brahman ({#पारमेष्ट्य#}), superiority ({#माहाराज्य#}),
<div n="lb">mastership ({#आधिपत्य#}), independence ({#स्वावश्य#}) and a long
<div n="lb">residence there ({#आतिष्ठ#}), these divinities being accompanied
<div n="lb">severally, like the Vasus, with various metres, Stomas
<div n="lb">and Sāmans (as specified in the text of the {%Ait. Br.%}). All
<div n="lb">these gods having then proclaimed the high qualities of
<div n="lb">Indra, to strike terror, by their panegyric, into the mind
<div n="lb">of his enemies, and Prajāpati who performed the function
<div n="lb">of inaugurating priest, having recited the {%Ṛgveda%}-verse 1.
<div n="lb">25. 10. (where between the ending words {#साम्राज्याय#} and
<div n="lb">{#सुक्रतुः#} the words {#भौज्याय, स्वाराज्याय#} &c. &c. are inserted),
<div n="lb">the latter placed himself before (i. e. east of) the throne with
<div n="lb">his face towards the west, covered the head of Indra with a
<div n="lb">moist {%Udumbara%} branch (i. e. with an Udumbara branch the
<div n="lb">leaves of which had been wetted) and a gold Pavitra (q. v.)
<div n="lb">and sprinkled him with the liquid, while reciting the three
<div n="lb">{%Ṛgveda%}-verses ‘these waters &c.’, the {%Yajurveda%}-verse
<div n="lb">‘the divine Savitṛ &c.’ and uttering the three sacred words,
[Page278-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">{%Bhūr, Bhuvas, Swar%} (see above page 276 {%a,%} line 22 ff.). Thirty-
<div n="lb">one days after this inauguration by Prajāpati, the divine
<div n="lb">{%Vasus%} sprinkled him in the East with the same liquid while
<div n="lb">reciting the same verses and uttering the same sacred words,
<div n="lb">to ensure his righteous government ({#साम्राज्य#}), hence the
<div n="lb">inaugurated kings of the Eastern peoples are called {%Samrāj;%}
<div n="lb">next in thirty-one days the {%Rudras%} performed the same
<div n="lb">ceremony in the South to ensure his increase of enjoyment
<div n="lb">({#भौज्य#}), hence the inaugurated kings of the {%Satwats%} in the
<div n="lb">South are called {%Bhoja;%} then in other thirty-one days the
<div n="lb">{%Ādityas%} performed this ceremony in the West, to ensure
<div n="lb">his independent rule ({#स्वाराज्य#}), hence the inaugurated kings
<div n="lb">of the {%Nīchyas%} and {%Apāchyas%} in the West are called {%Svarāj;%}
<div n="lb">then in other thirty-one days, the {%Viśve-Devas%} in the North,
<div n="lb">to ensure his attainment of higher qualities than those pos-
<div n="lb">sessed by others ({#वैराज्य#}), hence the inaugurated kings of
<div n="lb">the {%Uttarakurus%} and {%Uttaramadras%} are called {%Virāj;%} after-
<div n="lb">wards in other thirty-one days the {%Sādhyas%} and {%Āptyas%}
<div n="lb">performed the same ceremony in the central region (which
<div n="lb">is the ‘fixed’ region, since east, west &c. become deter-
<div n="lb">mined through it, and which at the same time is the region
<div n="lb">where the vaidik rites are established), for the sake of his
<div n="lb">rulership ({#राज्य#}), hence the inaugurated kings of the {%Kurus%}
<div n="lb">and {%Pañchālas%} and of the {%Vaśas%} and {%Uśīnaras%} in that re-
<div n="lb">gion are called {%Rājan.%} Lastly, in further thirty-one days the
<div n="lb">{%Maruts%} and the {%Angirasas%} performed this ceremony in the upper
<div n="lb">region (or Swarga) to ensure his attainment of the supreme
<div n="lb">abode ({#पारमेष्ठ्य#}), his mighty rule there over every one
<div n="lb">({#माहाराज्य#}), as well as his mastership ({#आधिपत्य#}), inde-
<div n="lb">pendence ({#स्वावश्य#}) and long residence there ({#आतिष्ठ#}), hence
<div n="lb">he attained the supreme abode ({#परमेष्ठिन्#}) and became
<div n="lb">united with Prajāpati ({#प्राजापत्य#}). ‘Thus inaugurated by
<div n="lb">that great inauguration Indra conquered all conquerable
<div n="lb">battle grounds ({#जितीः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#जेतव्याः सर्वा युद्धभूमीः#}),
<div n="lb">took possession of all worlds, obtained the highest dignity

<div n="lb">and preeminence ({#परमताम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#उत्कृष्टत्वम्#}), conquered
<div n="lb">righteous government, increase of enjoyment, absolute do-
<div n="lb">minion, distinguished qualities, supreme abode, rulership
<div n="lb">and mighty rule and mastership there; and thus he became
<div n="lb">in this world a Prajāpati, an absolute king, long-lived
<div n="lb">({#अमृतः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#इतरमनुष्यवदल्पकाले मरणरहितः#}), and
<div n="lb">in the other world having obtained all his desires, he be-

<div n="lb">{%Sāy.:%} = {#मरणरहितो मुक्तः#}).
<div n="P">The purpose for which the inauguration of a mortal king
<div n="lb">takes place, is defined by the {%Aitar. Br.%} in precisely the
<div n="lb">same terms as those contained in the preceding passage,
<div n="lb">[with the obvious alteration of ‘amongst kings’ instead of
<div n="lb">‘amongst gods’. This definition occurs ch. 39. 5.; in the
<div n="lb">commencement of ch. 39. 1. the purpose of the ceremony is
<div n="lb">worded somewhat differently at the end of the passage but
<div n="lb">its bearing is similar, viz.: if he (i. e. a priest) wishes that
<div n="lb">a king should conquer all conquerable battle grounds &c.
<div n="lb">&c…(up to the words: ‘and mastership there’), that
[Page278-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">he should attain (every thing) in space and time ({#अयं#}
<div n="lb">{#समन्तपर्यायी स्यात्;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#देशतः कालतः सर्वव्यापी स्यात्#}),
<div n="lb">all land up to the seashore and all life to infinity (lit.

<div n="lb">{#परार्धात्परार्धशब्दाभिधेयकालसंख्यापर्यन्तं सार्वायुषत्वं काल-#}

<div n="lb">whole earth up to the ocean ({#पृथिव्यै समुद्रपर्यन्ताया एक-#}
<div n="lb">{#राट्#}), let him &c. &c…and: if a king wishes, that he
<div n="lb">should conquer &c. &c., let him &c.].--The ceremony as
<div n="lb">practised at the {%vaidik period,%} is thus described in the {%Ait.%}
<div n="lb">{%Br.%} The priest in the commencement of the solemnity
<div n="lb">causes the king to take the following oath: ‘if I (the king)
<div n="lb">do ever harm to thee, thou (the priest) mayst deprive me
<div n="lb">of all pious acts ({#इष्टापूर्तम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#श्रौतस्मार्तद्वयम्#}) which
<div n="lb">I have done from the time of my birth up to that of my
<div n="lb">death, of heaven and whatever else good has been accom-
<div n="lb">plished by me, of long life and offspring’. He then orders
<div n="lb">his attendants to bring four kinds of fruits: the fruit of
<div n="lb">the {%Nyagrodha%} (ficus Indica), of the {%Udumbara%} (ficus glo-
<div n="lb">merata), of the {%Aśvattha%} (ficus religiosa) and of the {%Plaksha%}
<div n="lb">(ficus infectoria); besides, four kinds of grain ({#औषधानि#}
<div n="lb">{#…तोक्मकृतानि;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#अङ्कुरनिमित्तान्यौषधिद्रव्याणि#}):
<div n="lb">rice with small grain ({#व्रीद्दीणाम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#सूक्ष्मवीजरूपा व्री-#}
<div n="lb">{#हयः#}), rice with large grain ({#महाव्रीहीणाम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#प्रौढ-#}
<div n="lb">{#वीजरूपा महाव्रीहयः#}), {%Priyangu%} and barley. Next they
<div n="lb">bring, at his command, a throne-seat of {%Udumbara%} wood
<div n="lb">(made in the manner as described above, page 275{%a,%} line 34 ff.),
<div n="lb">a (four-cornered) ladle of {%Udumbara%} or, instead of the latter,
<div n="lb">a vessel of {%Udumbara%} (or, acc. to {%Sāyaṇa,%} an earthen vessel
<div n="lb">of an arbitrary shape) and an {%Udumbara%} branch. Then they
<div n="lb">put the four kinds of fruit and grain in the ladle or vessel
<div n="lb">and pour over them curds, honey, clarified butter and water
<div n="lb">proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen
<div n="lb">down; afterwards, having placed the ladle or vessel on the
<div n="lb">ground, they address the throne-seat with a Mantra which
<div n="lb">recalls the component parts of Indra's throne and thus
<div n="lb">tends to identify both: ‘may thy front legs be Bṛhat and
<div n="lb">Rathantara &c. &c.; may Savitṛ and Bṛhaspati support
<div n="lb">thy fore-legs &c. &c. (see above page 277{%b,%} line 1 ff.)’. Then
<div n="lb">the priest asks the king to ascend the throne-seat, inviting
<div n="lb">the Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas and the other divinities which
<div n="lb">were invited by Indra at his inauguration (see page 277{%b,%}
<div n="lb">line 31 ff.), to ascend his throne with the same metres, Stomas
<div n="lb">and Sāmans and for the same purposes as mentioned above.
<div n="lb">Upon this the relatives of the king (literally: ‘the king-
<div n="lb">makers’, {#राजकर्तारः;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#पितृभ्रात्रादयः#} ‘father, bro-
<div n="lb">ther &c.’), proclaim his high qualities in the same words
<div n="lb">as the gods proclaimed the greatness of Indra; the priest
<div n="lb">recites the {%Ṛgveda%}-verse 1. 25. 10. (with the same modifica-
<div n="lb">tions as mentioned above) and, placing himself before the
<div n="lb">throne with his face towards the west, covers the head of the
<div n="lb">king with the Udumbara branch, the leaves of which have
<div n="lb">been wetted, and with a gold Pavitra, and sprinkles him
<div n="lb">with the liquid (in the ladle or vessel), while reciting the
<div n="lb">three {%Ṛgveda%}-verses, the {%Yajurveda%}-verse and uttering the
[Page279-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">three sacred words mentioned above (page 276{%a,%} line 22 ff.).
<div n="lb">Lastly he addresses the king with the prayer that the Vasus,
<div n="lb">the Rudras and the other divinities who performed this cere-
<div n="lb">mony for Indra in the East, South &c. may severally do the
<div n="lb">same for him in thirty-one successive days and to the same
<div n="lb">effect as mentioned before (page 278{%a,%} line 1 ff.).--The in-
<div n="lb">gredients of the sacred liquid used at this Abhisheka differ in
<div n="lb">some measure, as will have been seen, from those used at
<div n="lb">the {%Punarabhisheka;%} they differ from the latter also in their
<div n="lb">typical qualities. The {%Nyagrodha%} being on account of its
<div n="lb">wide spread the Rājan of the trees, and rice with small
<div n="lb">grain being among plants principally productive of strength,
<div n="lb">the fruit of the former and the grain of the latter are the
<div n="lb">type of the qualities of a Kshatra ({#क्षत्रम्#}), which the king
<div n="lb">is supposed to acquire by these ingredients; and in a si-
<div n="lb">milar manner the fruit of the {%Udumbara%} and the grains of
<div n="lb">{%Priyangu%} are the type of increase of enjoyment ({#भौज्यम्#}),
<div n="lb">the fruit of the {%Aśvattha%} and rice with large grains the
<div n="lb">type of righteous government ({#साम्राज्यम्#}), the fruit of the
<div n="lb">{%Plaksha%} the type of independent rule ({#स्वाराज्यम्#}) and at-
<div n="lb">tainment of more distinguished qualities than those pos-
<div n="lb">sessed by other kings ({#वैराज्यम्#}), barley the type of mi-
<div n="lb">litary commandership ({#सैनान्यम्#}); curds typify the sharpness
<div n="lb">of senses ({#इन्द्रियम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because they make the senses
<div n="lb">sharp’: {#इन्द्रियपाटवहेतुत्वात्#}), honey typifies the essence
<div n="lb">of plants and trees ({#रस ओषधिवनस्पतिषु;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because
<div n="lb">it originates in flowers’: {#पुष्पजन्यत्वेन#}); clarified butter, the
<div n="lb">brightness of cattle ({#तेजः पशूनाम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘on account of its
<div n="lb">oily gloss’: {#स्निग्धभास्करत्वेन#}) and the water, freedom from
<div n="lb">death or long life ({#अमृतम्;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because it nourrishes’
<div n="lb">{#आप्यायनहेतुत्वात्#}).--The ceremony having been completed,
<div n="lb">the king has to make a present to the inaugurating priest, viz.
<div n="lb">a thousand (Nishkas) of gold, a field and cattle ({#चतुष्पाद्;#}
<div n="lb">{%Sāy.:%} {#गवादिकम्#} cows &c.); but this amount seems merely
<div n="lb">to constitute a minimum acknowledgement of the exertions
<div n="lb">of the priest; for the text of the Aitareya adds that ‘they
<div n="lb">say, a king should give innumerable, illimited presents,
<div n="lb">since a king is illimited (in wealth) and thus will obtain
<div n="lb">illimited benefit to himself’; and the author of the {%Aitar.%}
<div n="lb">{%Br.%} seems rather inclined to adopt the latter opinion, for,
<div n="lb">amongst the instances he gives of royal inaugurations which
<div n="lb">have been performed in this fashion, he does not mention
<div n="lb">such at which the Brāhmaṇas received the ‘limited’ gifts,
<div n="lb">but tells, e. g., that {%Udamaya,%} the son of Atri, promised
<div n="lb">to his priest ten thousand elephants and ten thousand
<div n="lb">female slaves and gave each of the sons of that priest every
<div n="lb">day at the noon-oblation two thousand cows out of a
<div n="lb">thousand millions; that {%Anga%} gave his priest eighty thou-
<div n="lb">sand young white horses fit for carrying burdens on their
<div n="lb">back &c.; that {%Bharata%} distributed in Maṣṇāra a hundred
<div n="lb">and seven thousand millions of black elephants with white
<div n="lb">tucks and decked with gold &c. &c. (comp. also {%Colebr.%}
<div n="lb">{%Ess.%} I. p. 41 ff.).--After the priest has received the gift,
<div n="lb">he hands to the king a goblet of spirituous liquor in re-
<div n="lb">citing the verse: ‘Soma with thy most sweet exhilarating
<div n="lb">drops &c.’ (see above p. 276{%b,%} line 13ff.), and the king drinks
[Page279-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">of it after having recited this verse: ‘what is left (in this
<div n="lb">goblet) of the tasteful liquid and what Indra (drank when
<div n="lb">it was consecrated by) various rites, that portion of it I
<div n="lb">consume now with a placid mind, (as if it were) the royal
<div n="lb">Soma’, and this verse: ‘to thee, supreme (Indra), I offer
<div n="lb">this liquid for drink, for it has been poured out on thy
<div n="lb">behalf, rejoice in it until thou art happy’; [the former of
<div n="lb">these mantras occurs with a few variations in the {%Vājas.,%}
<div n="lb">19. 35., the other in the {%Ṛgv.,%} 8. 45. 22. or {%Sāmav.,%} 1. 161.].
<div n="lb">By this manner of drinking, the spirituous liquor becomes
<div n="lb">a kind of Soma, and it is the Soma not the spirituous liquor
<div n="lb">that is drunk by the king. Lastly the king recites the two
<div n="lb">{%Ṛgveda%}-verses 8. 48. 3. and 4. [What follows in the text of
<div n="lb">the {%Aitareya Br.%} up to the end of the 39<sup>th</sup> ch. are illustra-
<div n="lb">tations of the happiness which is felt by a king in conse-
<div n="lb">quence of such an inauguration, and historical instances of

<div n="lb">stowed liberal gifts on the functioning priests; for this

<div n="lb">by another passage of the {%Śāntīp.%} (v. 2496) which says
<div n="lb">‘that inaugurating a king is a chief duty of the people of
<div n="lb">a country…for the Veda states: because they chose
<div n="lb">Indra for their king &c…’ ({#राष्ट्रस्यैतत्कृत्यतमं राज्ञ एवा-#}
<div n="lb">{#भिषेचनम्…इन्द्रमेव प्रवृणुते यद्राजानमिति श्रुतिः#} &c.;
<div n="lb">{%Arjunam.%} {#राष्ट्रस्य = अस्य देशवासिनो लोकस्य#}). Yet it re-
<div n="lb">sults from the description given in the Epic poems that the
<div n="lb">vaidik ceremony had undergone various modifications at
<div n="lb">the time of their composition.--As the inauguration of
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} was intended and the necessary preparations for it
<div n="lb">were made, when his father {%Daśaratha%} was still alive, but
<div n="lb">as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-
<div n="lb">mother {%Kaikeyī,%} did not take place then, but fourteen years
<div n="lb">later, after the death of {%Daśaratha,%} an account of the pre-
[Page280-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">paratory ceremonies is given in the {%Ayodhyākāṇda%} as well
<div n="lb">as in the {%Yuddhakāṇḍa%} of the Rāmāyaṇa, but an account
<div n="lb">of the complete ceremony in the latter book alone. Accord-
<div n="lb">ing to the {%Ayodhyāk.%} on the day preceding the intended inau-
<div n="lb">guration {%Rāma%} and his wife {%Sītā%} held a fast, and in the night
<div n="lb">they performed this preliminary rite: {%Rāma,%} having made
<div n="lb">his ablutions, approached the idol of Nārāyaṇa, took a
<div n="lb">cup of clarified butter, as the religious law prescribes ({#वि-#}
<div n="lb">{#धिवत्#}), made a libation of it into the kindled fire and drank
<div n="lb">the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his
<div n="lb">heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity, he lay,
<div n="lb">silent and composed, together with {%Sītā,%} on a bed of Kuśa-
<div n="lb">grass, which was spread before the altar of Viṣṇu, until
<div n="lb">the last watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered
<div n="lb">the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At day-break,
<div n="lb">reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he per-
<div n="lb">formed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity.
<div n="lb">In the mean time the town Ayodhyā had assumed a festive
<div n="lb">appearance and the inauguration implements had been ar-
<div n="lb">ranged: a beautiful golden throne-seat ({#भद्रासन#} or {#सिं-#}
<div n="lb">{#हासन,#} also called in other passages {#भद्रपीठ;#} the vaidik
<div n="lb">term is {#आसन्दी#}) covered with a tiger-skin, water taken
<div n="lb">from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna as well as from
<div n="lb">other sacred rivers in all directions and from all oceans,
<div n="lb">golden jars filled with shoots of the {%Udumbara%} tree and
<div n="lb">various lotus flowers ({#पद्मोत्पल#}), {%Ruchakas%} (citrons?) and
<div n="lb">{%Rochanas%} (pomegranates?), clarified butter, honey, milk,
<div n="lb">curd, as well as soil, water and other propitious objects
<div n="lb">taken from places of pilgrimage ({#तीर्थ#}), a white pearl
<div n="lb">sceptre, a {%chowri%} ({#चामर#}), a fan, and a white parasol
<div n="lb">decorated with beautiful garlands; besides, a white bull, a
<div n="lb">white horse and a splendid, furious elephant ({#मत्तो गजवरः#}),
<div n="lb">also eight beautiful damsels in fine attire, all kinds of mu-
<div n="lb">sical instruments and bards in festive dress. [This is the
<div n="lb">account according to the text of the {%Rāmāyaṇa%} in Mr. {%Gor-%}
<div n="lb">{%resio'%}s edition; the edition of {%Schlegel,%} mentions (2. 15. 4-12)
<div n="lb">the following implements and in the following order: golden
<div n="lb">waterjars, an ornamented throne-seat, a chariot covered
<div n="lb">with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence
<div n="lb">of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred
<div n="lb">rivers, tanks, wells, lakes and from all oceans, honey,
<div n="lb">curd, clarified butter, fried grain ({#लाजाः#}), Kuśa grass,
<div n="lb">flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels and a splen-
<div n="lb">did, furious elephant; golden and silver jars, filled with
<div n="lb">water, covered with {%Udumbara%} branches ({#क्षीरिभिश्छन्नाः#})
<div n="lb">and various lotus flowers; besides a white, jewelled {%chowrie%}
<div n="lb">({#बालव्यजन#}), a white splendid parasol, a white bull, a
<div n="lb">white horse, all manners of musical instruments and bards.
<div n="lb">A similar enumeration occurs in the preceding chapter
<div n="lb">v. 32 ff. of the same edition where the throne-seat is defined
<div n="lb">as ‘made of {%Udumbara%} wood’, the chariot as ‘drawn by
<div n="lb">four horses’, the bull as ‘accoutred with golden ropes, full-
<div n="lb">grown (lit. having its hump) and white’, and the horse as
<div n="lb">‘strong and having four large teeth’; there are mentioned
<div n="lb">also {%two%} white {%chowries,%} instead of one, and all kinds
<div n="lb">of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a scimitar ({#निस्त्रिंश#}), a
[Page281-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">bow, a litter ({#वाहनं नरसंयुक्तम्;#} comm. = {#शिविकादि#}), a gol-
<div n="lb">den vase ({#भृङ्गारं हिरण्मयम्#}) and a blazing fire, and amongst
<div n="lb">the living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards,
<div n="lb">gaudy courtezans, and besides the eight damsels: ‘profes-
<div n="lb">sors of divinity ({#आचार्याः#}), Brāhmaṇas, cows and pure
<div n="lb">kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town-and
<div n="lb">country-people and the citizens with their train’.--The
<div n="lb">whole passage however (2. 14. 32-39.) seems to be an inter-
<div n="lb">polation in the speech of {%Vasiṣṭha,%} at variance with the
<div n="lb">hurry of his message to the king and made superfluous
<div n="lb">by the narrative of the following chapter.] The {%Yuddha-%}
<div n="lb">{%kāṇḍa%} mentions of implements only a jewelled throne-seat
<div n="lb">({#रत्नमयं पीठम्#}) and four golden jars ornamented with
<div n="lb">jewels in which four monkey chiefs, the allies of {%Rāma%} in
<div n="lb">his war against {%Rāvaṇa,%} carried water from the ocean of
<div n="lb">the four regions; {%Ṛṣabha%} carried it from the southern
<div n="lb">ocean, his jar being filled with red sandal branches, {%Jāmbavat%}
<div n="lb">from the western ocean, his jar being ornamented with aloe
<div n="lb">shoots; {%Vegadarśin%} from the northern ocean, his jar being
<div n="lb">decorated with large branches (of what tree, is not said),
<div n="lb">and {%Suṣeṇa%} from the eastern ocean, his jar being orna-
<div n="lb">mented with bracelets ({#? अङ्गदकेयूरैः#}).--Of the ceremony
<div n="lb">itself it is said that it was performed in the fashion of
<div n="lb">Indra's inauguration, but a first difference which, to judge
<div n="lb">from the scanty detail of the text, appears to exist between
<div n="lb">the manner in which the ceremony was conducted at the
<div n="lb">epic and that in which it is conducted in the vaidik period,
<div n="lb">is that the wife of Rāma shares in a portion of the cere-
<div n="lb">monies and in a seat on the throne with her husband, while
<div n="lb">a participation of the wife of the king in the ceremony is
<div n="lb">not mentioned in the {%Aitar. Br.;%} and a second and still
<div n="lb">more important difference results from the circumstance that
<div n="lb">not merely {%Vasiṣṭha,%} the officiating priest, sprinkled Rāma
<div n="lb">with the consecrated liquid, but after him ‘{%Vāmadeva, Jā-%}
<div n="lb">{%bāli, Vijaya, Kāśyapa, Gotama, Kātyāyana, Viśvāmitra%} and
<div n="lb">other eminent Brāhmaṇas; moreover, after them, in suc-
<div n="lb">cession, the assistant priests, the damsels, the military
<div n="lb">chiefs and the citizens, the gods shedding over him from
<div n="lb">the sky the essence of all plants’; for although the Vasus
<div n="lb">and other gods sprinkled Indra with the liquid, to inau-
<div n="lb">gurate him as king of the several heavenly quarters, no
<div n="lb">mention is made in the vaidik ceremony, as applied to a
<div n="lb">mortal king, that any one else but the officiating priest
<div n="lb">inaugurated the king with the sacred liquid, or that the
<div n="lb">active share of the assembly in the ceremony goes beyond
<div n="lb">their eulogizing the good qualities of the king. A com-
<div n="lb">parison, besides, between the implements of inauguration
<div n="lb">at the two periods and between the ingredients which con-
<div n="lb">stitute the consecration-liquid of the vaidik and that of
<div n="lb">the epic ceremony, show that the typical quality of the
<div n="lb">former had, in a great measure, been lost sight of at the
<div n="lb">period of the epic poems.--The same and other de-
<div n="lb">viations are apparent in the account which is given in
<div n="lb">the {%Śāntiparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata,%} of {%Yudhisṭhira'%}s inau-
<div n="lb">guration: ‘Free from anger and pain the royal son of {%Kuntī%}
<div n="lb">sat down joyfully on the golden throne-seat ({#परमासन#}),
[Page281-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">his face turned towards the east; in front of him took their
<div n="lb">seat on a beautiful golden stool ({#पीठ#}) the valiant {%Sātyaki%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vāsudeva;%} at either side of him, on fine-shaped jewelled
<div n="lb">stools the noble {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Arjuna;%} on a sumptuous
<div n="lb">ivory throne-seat embellished with gold (but acc. to a comm.
<div n="lb">‘on a sumptuous {%solid%} throne-seat’; {#दान्ते सिंहासने,#} {%Arju-%}
<div n="lb">{%nam.:%} {#दान्ते संहर्षक्षमे#}), {%Prithā%} with {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula,%}
<div n="lb">and on seats as brilliant as fire separately {%Sudharman%} (the
<div n="lb">priest of Duryodhana) {%Vidura, Dhaumya%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">as well as the pugnacious {%Sanjaya%} and the illustrious
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī,%} all entering from the side whence came {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra.%} But the righteous king having taken his seat,
<div n="lb">touched with his fingers white flowers, auspicious emblems
<div n="lb">({#स्वस्तिकान्#}), fried grain ({#अक्षतान्#}), the soil, gold, silver
<div n="lb">and a pearl; when all his subjects, headed by the house
<div n="lb">priest, became aware that he had thus possessed himself in
<div n="lb">an auspicious manner of earth, gold and the various kinds of
<div n="lb">jewels. The implements of the inauguration prepared and
<div n="lb">ready, were: filled jars made of gold, {%Udumbara%} wood,
<div n="lb">silver and clay, flowers, fried grain ({#लाजाः#}), sacrificial
<div n="lb">grass ({#बर्हिस्#}), cow's milk, fuel of {%Śami%} (Acacia suma)-,
<div n="lb">{%Aśvattha%} (Ficus religiosa)-, and {%Palāśa%} (Butea frondosa)-
<div n="lb">wood, honey and clarified butter, a ladle ({#श्रुव#}) made of
<div n="lb">{%Udumbara%}-wood, and a conch ({#शङ्ख#}) ornamented with gold.
<div n="lb">Then, in obedience to the orders of {%Kṛṣṇa, Dhaumya,%} the
<div n="lb">family priest, marked the sacrificial ground with a line in
<div n="lb">the direction of north-east ({#प्रागुदक्प्लवने वेदीं लक्षणेनोपलिख्य#}
<div n="lb">{#च#}), requested the noble king and the dark daughter of
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} to be seated on the white, solid-legged throne-seat
<div n="lb">({#सर्वतोभद्र आसने;#} comp. {#भद्रासन, भद्रपीठ#}) which was
<div n="lb">brilliant like fire and covered over with a tiger-skin, and
<div n="lb">made a libation into fire while reciting the appropriate
<div n="lb">mantras ({#जुहाव पावकं धीमान्विधिमन्त्रपुरस्कृतम्#}). Upon
<div n="lb">this {%Kṛṣṇa%} took his venerated conch and sprinkled (with
<div n="lb">its contents) {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} the son of Kuntī, (inaugurating
<div n="lb">him thus) as lord of the earth, and after him {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">the royal Ṛṣi (sprinkled the king) and then all his sub-
<div n="lb">jects’.--The present made at this occasion by {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} consisted of a thousand Nishkas he gave to the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇas (somewhat in conformity with the injunction of
<div n="lb">the {%Aitar. Br.%}); but the liberality of {%Rāma%} was more re-
<div n="lb">markable: he gave the Brāhmaṇas a million milch cows,
<div n="lb">ten thousand bulls and three hundred millions Nishkas, be-
<div n="lb">sides carts, ornaments, cloths, beds and seats, and nu-
<div n="lb">merous villages; he made liberal presents, too, to the
<div n="lb">monkey chiefs and the monkeys, his allies.--It is, worthy
<div n="lb">of note, that a custom is met with, in the epic poems, the
<div n="lb">origin of which cannot with certainty be traced to the in-
<div n="lb">junctions of the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,%} viz. a king's having a son
<div n="lb">or relative of his inaugurated as {#युवराज#} (also {#युवराजन्#}) or
<div n="lb">‘junior king’. For, although {%Sāyaṇa'%}s commentary speaks
<div n="lb">of ‘a father, brother &c.’ who eulogize the king before the
<div n="lb">priest sprinkles him with the sacred liquid, and although the
<div n="lb">presence of the father at the ceremony {%might%} countenance
<div n="lb">the inference that the vaidik text implies also the inau-
<div n="lb">guration of a {%Yuvarāja,%} it must be observed that the text
[Page282-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">of the Brāhmaṇa does not contain the quoted words
<div n="lb">but in their stead the term {#राजकर्तारः#} ‘king-makers’,
<div n="lb">which may or may not comprise the paternal relationship.
<div n="lb">On the other hand it must be admitted that the vaidik in-
<div n="lb">junction is not at variance with this ceremony, which, once
<div n="lb">performed, seems to hold good for the inauguration of the
<div n="lb">prince at his accession to the throne, after the father's
<div n="lb">death, since no mention is made, in the epic poems, of a
<div n="lb">repetition of the ceremony. The object of the inauguration
<div n="lb">of a prince as {%Yuvarāja%} is to secure to him the right of
<div n="lb">succession, and, besides, the advantages supposed to arise
<div n="lb">from the religious ceremony, as mentioned before, a share
<div n="lb">in the government, or perhaps all the privileges of a
<div n="lb">reigning king. For when {%Daśaratha%} intends to make his
<div n="lb">son {%Rāma%} a {%Yuvarāja,%} he addresses him with these words
<div n="lb">(in the {%Āyodhyākāṇḍa%}): ‘Rāma, I am old; I have lived
<div n="lb">long and enjoyed every pleasure I desired; hundreds of
<div n="lb">sacrifices I have performed when I distributed food and
<div n="lb">liberal presents; thou wast born the son of my desire, for
<div n="lb">no one is equal to thee on earth; thus I have paid my
<div n="lb">debt to the gods, the Ṛṣis, my deceased ancestors, the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇas and my own self; nothing remains for me to
<div n="lb">be done save inaugurating thee; therefore what I am about
<div n="lb">to tell thee, thou must do. To day all my subjects want
<div n="lb">thee for their king; therefore, my son, I shall inaugurate
<div n="lb">thee as junior king’; and {%Rāma%} reports to his mother:
<div n="lb">‘mother, I am ordered by my father to undertake the
<div n="lb">government of the country; to-morrow my inauguration
<div n="lb">will take place, for such is the behest of my father’. An-
<div n="lb">other instance of the installation as {%Yuvarāja%} is that of
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} ({%Ādip.%} v. 5517), or of {%Bhīma-%}
<div n="lb">{%sena%} by his brother {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ({%Śāntip.%} v. 1475); one of
<div n="lb">a simultaneous inauguration of a king and of his son, is
<div n="lb">that of {%Dyumatsena%} as king and of his son as {%Yuvarāja;%}
<div n="lb">({%Vanap.:%} {#ततोऽभिषिषिचुः प्रीत्या द्युमत्सेनं पुरोहिताः । पुत्रं#}
<div n="lb">{#चास्य महात्मानं यौवराज्येऽभिषेचयन्#}).
<div n="P">The inauguration ceremony at the {%Paurāṇic%} period has
<div n="lb">but little affinity with the vaidik rite; it is a series of pro-
<div n="lb">ceedings which are founded on late superstitions and reflect
<div n="lb">scarcely any of the ideas which are the groundwork of the
<div n="lb">ceremony of the {%Aitar. Br.%} A description--though a
<div n="lb">loose and desultory one--of the {%Paurāṇic Abhisheka%} oc-
<div n="lb">curs in the 209<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Agni-Purāṇa.%} It commences
<div n="lb">with the injunction that a king should before his inaugura-
<div n="lb">tion choose his astrologer ({#सांवत्सर#}), his family-priest
<div n="lb">({#पुरोहित#}), his officiating-priest ({#ऋत्विज्#}), his ministers
<div n="lb">({#मन्त्रिन्#}) and his queen ({#महिषी#}). [Comp. {%Manu%} 7. 77 &c.]
<div n="lb">The astrologer fixes the proper time for the inauguration
<div n="lb">(comp. page 284{%b,%} line 51 ff.); the king takes a bath prepared
<div n="lb">with Sesamum and white mustard seeds ({#तिलैः सिद्धार्थकैः#}
<div n="lb">{#स्नानम्#}); the astrologer and the family-priest hail the king
<div n="lb">with the cry of ‘victory’, and he being seated on a throne-
<div n="lb">seat ({#भद्रासन#}) makes a proclamation of peace or public
<div n="lb">safety and grants freedom to his prisoners. Then before
<div n="lb">his inauguration by the family-priest takes place, he ad-
<div n="lb">dresses a propitiatory prayer to Indra, and fasting on the
[Page282-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">day of the inauguration makes libations to the Manus &c. (?)
<div n="lb">and pays respect to a sacrificial jar which is placed on the
<div n="lb">right or southern side of the sacrificial fire, with perfumes
<div n="lb">and flowers. [The text of this passage in the two Mss. of
<div n="lb">the {%Agni-P.%} at London, that alone contain a description of
<div n="lb">the ceremony and could be consulted by me, is very cor-
<div n="lb">rupt; the Ms. of the Royal As. Soc. in Devan. char. reads:

<div n="lb">The king, to prepare himself for the inauguration, purifies

<div n="lb">throne, then the Kshatriya minister with milk out of a
<div n="lb">silver jar which stands south, next the Vaiśya minister
<div n="lb">with curds out of a copper jar which stands west, and

<div n="lb">which stands north of the throne [{#…भद्रासनगतं नृपम् ।#}

<div n="P">Another account of a royal inauguration, which is si-
<div n="lb">milar to that of the Agni-Purāṇa and perhaps belongs to
<div n="lb">a still more recent period than the latter, is that of the
<div n="lb">{%Mānasāra,%} a work on Architecture and reputedly the com-
<div n="lb">pletest of its kind. [The high antiquity which is ascribed
<div n="lb">by the Hindus to this work will become more than doubt-
<div n="lb">ful, from a comparison, for instance, of this portion of it
<div n="lb">with the 209<sup>th</sup> ch. of the Agni-P. The only Ms. of this
<div n="lb">work, I could consult, is hopelessly incorrect and does
<div n="lb">not permit to make a reliable translation of it; it is a copy
[Page284-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">of an ancient Ms. in Tamul characters which was discovered
<div n="lb">at Trichinopoly, is imperfect at the beginning and at the
<div n="lb">end, was written out under the direction of Mr. Ch. P.
<div n="lb">Brown and is now in possession of the E. I. H.; its ex-
<div n="lb">treme rareness in India as well as in Europe makes it ad-
<div n="lb">viseable to draw attention to some particulars of its de-
<div n="lb">scription of a royal inauguration which may be rendered
<div n="lb">in a safe manner.] The {%Mānasāra%} puts forward two per-
<div n="lb">sonages in the inauguration ceremony who do not make
<div n="lb">their appearance in the foregoing accounts: the {%Sthapati%} or
<div n="lb">the architect, and the {%Sthāpaka%} or (probably) the master
<div n="lb">of the ceremonies. According to this work, the throne is
<div n="lb">placed in a handsome sacrificial building where the inau-
<div n="lb">guration takes place ({#यागमण्डपे सौम्ये तु सिंहासनस्य चो-#}
<div n="lb">{#परि । नृपालं तत्र संस्थाप्य अभिषेकं समारभेत्;#} some such
<div n="lb">building seems to be implied also by the description of the
<div n="lb">Agni-Purāṇa, since a ‘door-keeper’ is mentioned, but it
<div n="lb">is not expressedly named); the inauguration liquid, which
<div n="lb">consists of river and sea-water is consecrated by chanting
<div n="lb">hymns from the Atharvaveda, Sāmaveda and other sacred
<div n="lb">works; ({#सरित्समुद्रसलिलकुम्भैः पूर्णविमाधवैः#} ({%sic%}) {#। अथर्व-#}
<div n="lb">{#सामगीतैश्च चान्यैश्चागममन्त्रकैः#}); the king marks his fore-
<div n="lb">head with the sign Tripuṇḍra (q. v.: {#पश्चात्तु होमनिष्ठां च#}
<div n="lb">{#दर्भं दत्त्वा त्रिपुण्ड्रकम् । ललाटसारणं कुर्याद्भूपतिस्तु यथावि-#}
<div n="lb">{#धि#}), anoints his body with sandal and saffron, and the
<div n="lb">{%Sthapati%} purifies him with the compound called {%Pancha-%}
<div n="lb">{%gavya%} (see above page 282{%b,%} line 45); them the family-priest
<div n="lb">places on his head the tiara, and this toilet being com-
<div n="lb">pleted, the {%Sthapati%} and the {%Sthāpaka%} invite the king to
<div n="lb">take place, with his queen, on the throne when the sacred
<div n="lb">liquid is sprinkled on his forehead while he bears the
<div n="lb">jewelled tiara ({#रत्नसंतुष्टमुकुटमूर्ध्वं राजोपधारयेत्#}). This
<div n="lb">ceremony having been performed under ‘benedictions and
<div n="lb">all manner of auspicious noises’ ({#सर्वमङ्गलघोषैश्च स्वस्तिवा-#}
<div n="lb">{#चनपूर्ववत्#}) the king mounts on an elephant and, under the
<div n="lb">sounds of a similar music, rides round his city, keeping
<div n="lb">his right side towards it, and distributes gifts amongst the
<div n="lb">spectators ({#कुर्यादारोहणं पश्चाद्राजा त्वैरावतोपरि । नगरी-#}
<div n="lb">{#प्रदक्षिणं कुर्यात्सर्वमङ्गलघोषकैः#}). These gifts which consist
<div n="lb">in corn and the like, cow's and other milk, weapons, and
<div n="lb">generally in any thing whether auspicious or not, the king
<div n="lb">should throw before himself and touch with his own hand,
<div n="lb">for in doing so he will not merely acquire strength, victory
<div n="lb">and glory but abundance of food &c. [A modern treatise on
<div n="lb">the royal inauguration, called {%Rājyābhiṣekapaddhati,%}--with-
<div n="lb">out either date or name of the author--is very prolix in the
<div n="lb">enumeration of the mantras; it quotes the {%Śatapathabr.%} and,
<div n="lb">among the Purāṇas, chiefly the {%Agni-P.;%} but it is rather
<div n="lb">an uncritical compilation from various books, than an au-
<div n="lb">thoritative source of information.]
<div n="P">The {%time of the inauguration%} must be an auspicious one.
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} was inaugurated when the moon entered the asterism
<div n="lb">{%Pushya,%} in the hour {%Abhijit;%} ({%Yuddhak.:%} {#ततः प्रभाते विमले#}

<div n="lb">{#रितः । रामं रत्नमये पीठे…उपवेश्य#} &c.).--The {%Agni-P.%}
<div n="lb">merely forbids the inauguration to take place at night
[Page285-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">time, but makes no further restriction ({#सांवत्सरो नृपं काले#}
<div n="lb">{#ससंभारोऽभिषेचनम् । कुर्यादृते रात्रिकालं कालस्य नियमः#}
<div n="lb">{#स्मृतः#}).--According to the astrological work {%Jyotishara-%}
<div n="lb">{%tnamālā,%} the inauguration of a king may take place when
<div n="lb">the moon enters either of the following asterisms: {%Anu-%}
<div n="lb">{%rādhā%} (17<sup>th</sup> ), {%Hasta%} (13<sup>th</sup> ), {%Pushya%} (8<sup>th</sup> ), {%Rohiṇi%} (4<sup>th</sup> ), {%Śra-%}
<div n="lb">{%vaṇa%} (23<sup>d</sup> ) and the three next to it (viz. {%Dhaniṣṭhā, Śata-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhiṣā, Pūrvabhādrapadā%}), {%Revatī%} (28<sup>th</sup> ), {%Mṛgaśiras%} (5<sup>th</sup> )

<div n="lb">{#च । रेवतीमृगशिरोऽश्विनीष्वपि क्ष्माभुजां समभिषेक इष्यते#}).--
<div n="lb">Another astrological work, the {%Muhūrtachintāmaṇī,%} lays
<div n="lb">down the following rules: ‘the inauguration of a king is
<div n="lb">auspicious, if it takes place at the period of the sun's pro-
<div n="lb">gress to the north of the equator, when Jupiter, the Moon
<div n="lb">and Venus have risen or those powerful planets: Mars, the
<div n="lb">Sun, the predominant or the minor planet which rule the
<div n="lb">(king's) nativity; but {%not%} on the fourth, ninth or fourteenth
<div n="lb">day of the month Chaitra, on a Tuesday, during the night
<div n="lb">or in an intercalary month. If it is performed at the
<div n="lb">conjunction of ill-omened planets with the first asterism
<div n="lb">(reckoned from that under which the king is born) their
<div n="lb">influence brings him illness; with the eighth, death; with
<div n="lb">the fifth, affliction of his sons; with the twelfth, poverty;
<div n="lb">with the tenth, it deprives him of energy; with the seventh
<div n="lb">or fourth, it destroys his sovereign power. All is au-
<div n="lb">spicious, however, if an auspicious planet enters into the
<div n="lb">circle. If Jupiter enters into conjunction with the ninth
<div n="lb">or fifth asterism (reckoned from that under which the king
<div n="lb">is born) or Mars with the sixth, or Venus with the tenth,
<div n="lb">the king will always enjoy royal happiness; if Saturn
<div n="lb">enters into conjunction with the third, the Sun with the
<div n="lb">eleventh or Jupiter with the tenth or fourth asterism (and
<div n="lb">the inauguration then takes place), his empire will remain
<div n="lb">firm’; [{#राजाभिषेकः शुभ उत्तरायणे गुर्विन्दुशुक्रैरुदितैर्बला-#}
