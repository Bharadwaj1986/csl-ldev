{#अनानुद#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-दः-दा-दम्#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Having no
follower, unaided, alone. <sup>2</sup> Unsurpassed in liberality (lit.
without any one who could give after, i. e. in a similar
manner). Both meanings of this word, as given according
to the comm., seem doubtful; it occurs as an epithet of
Indra and Brihaspati. E. {#अ#} priv. and {#अनुद,#} the first syllable
of the latter part of the compound being lengthened, or per-
haps {#अन#} priv. and {#अनुद#}.
