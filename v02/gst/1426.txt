{#अतीव#}¦ Tatpur. ind. Much, very much, much indeed. (Some-
times {#अतीव#} may be explained as representing the two
distinct words {#अति#} (the preposition) and {#इव#} which through
Sandhi form {#अतीव#} but which are not then to be considered
as an inseparable Tatpur. compound.) E. {#अति#} and {#इव#}.
