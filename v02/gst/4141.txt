{#अन्नविकार#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-रः#}) <sup>1</sup> Transformation of food; used
in general of any preparation of an article of food, e. g. of
{#सक्तु, पुरोडाश, सुरा, यवसुरा, पिष्टसुरा#} (comp. s. v. {#अन्न-#}
{#मल#}); according to an observation of Vardhamāna, however,
only of an artificial preparation, of made dishes, e. g. of
sweetmeats, {#शष्कुलीमोदक#} &c. (which would include, too,
the given instances {#सक्तु#} &c. occurring in the Mahābhāṣya,
Kāśikā, Bhaṭṭikāvya &c.), not of preparations which re-
present, as it were, the original substance only in a different
shape, as of {#पृथुक,#} rice or grain flattened, {#अपूप,#} cake of
flour &c. (This observation is in accordance, also, with
the author of the gaṇa {#अपूपादि#} to Pāṇ. V. 1. 4. where the
words {#अपूप#} and {#पृथुक#} occur besides {#अन्नविकार#}). <sup>2</sup> The
seminal secretion. <sup>3</sup> Transformation of the metaphysical
or mystical food; see {#अन्न#} 2. 2. and compare {#अन्नविकारत्व#}.
E. {#अन्न#} and {#विकार#}.
