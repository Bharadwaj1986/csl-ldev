I. {#अप#}¦ ind. (see {#निपात, उपसर्ग, गति, कर्मप्रवचनीय#}) A par-
<div n="lb">ticle implying the notion of ‘away’, in its literal and me-
<div n="lb">taphorical acceptations; it is used either as a prefix to verbs
<div n="lb">(and in this capacity, in the Vedas also detached from the
<div n="lb">verb, very much in the same manner as German prepositions
<div n="lb">when connected with verbs), or as a separable preposition,
<div n="lb">or in the Vedas sometimes also adverbially. With nouns it
<div n="lb">may form Tatpur., Bahuvr. and Avyayībh. compounds. [In
<div n="lb">many instances {#अव#} (q. v.) coincides in meaning with {#अप#}
<div n="lb">and in several also the prefix {#आ#} q. v.]
<div n="P">1. (as adverb in the Vedas) Away; e. g. {#अप द्वेषो अप#}
<div n="lb">{#ह्वरोऽन्यव्रतस्य सश्चिम#} (comm.: ‘scil. {#गच्छतु#}’).
<div n="P">2. (as a prefix to verbs it implies the notion of) <sup>1</sup> Away;
<div n="lb">e. g. with {#नी#} ‘to lead away’; with {#गम्#} ‘to go away’;
<div n="lb">with {#हृ#} ‘to take away, to rob’. <sup>2</sup> Deterioration; e. g. with
<div n="lb">{#कृ#} ‘to act improperly, to injure’; with {#दिश्#} ‘to simulate’;
<div n="lb">with {#वद्#} ‘to blame’. <sup>3</sup> Negation, contradiction; e. g. with
<div n="lb">{#लप्#} ‘to deny’; with {#मन्#} ‘to behave the reverse of respect-
<div n="lb">fully, to despise; with {#चि#} ‘to diminish’; if the base itself
<div n="lb">implies a negative notion, the prefix {#अप#} imparts to it fre-
<div n="lb">quently greater emphasis, e. g. with {#हन्, त्रप्, ह्नु#}.
<div n="P">3. (as a separable preposition with a noun depending
<div n="lb">on it in the ablative) <sup>1</sup> Away from; e. g. {#यत्संप्रत्यप लोके-#}
<div n="lb">{#भ्यो लङ्कायां वसतिर्भयात्#}. <sup>2</sup> Without; e. g. {#अप हरेः संसारः#}
<div n="lb"><sup>3</sup> With the exception of; e. g. {#अप त्रिगर्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः#}.
<div n="P">4. (in composition with nouns <sup>a.</sup> in Tatpur. and Bahuvr.
[Page157-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">compounds it implies the same meanings as the prefix to
<div n="lb">verbs, the notion of negation becoming in the Bahuvr. that
<div n="lb">of privation; <sup>b.</sup> in Avyayībh. compounds: <sup>1</sup> Away from;
<div n="lb">comp. {#अपसलवि#} and {#अपदिशम्,#} and the explan. of the
<div n="lb">comm. {%‘between’.%} <sup>2</sup> Without; e. g. {#अपविष्णु संसारः#}. <sup>3</sup> With
<div n="lb">the exception of; e. g. {#अपत्रिगंर्तं वृष्टो देवः#}. <sup>4</sup> Negation,
<div n="lb">contradiction; e. g. {#अपकामम्#}. [As upapada before {#स्था,#}
<div n="lb">{#अप#} has in a few derivations of this radical the influence
<div n="lb">of changing its initial {#स्#} into {#ष्;#} see {#अपष्ठ, अपष्ठु, अपष्ठुर,#}
<div n="lb">{#अपष्ठुल#}.--In the Ṛgveda {#अप#} occurs in its protracted form
<div n="lb">{#अपा#} before {#वृधि,#} and in composition with such derivatives
<div n="lb">of {#वृ#} as retain the vowel {#ऋ#} of the radical, see {#अपावृत,#}
<div n="lb">{#अपावृति#}.] E. unknown. See {#प#} and the Preface.
