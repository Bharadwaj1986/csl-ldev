{#अध#}¦ ind. ({#निपात#}) An inceptive particle which occurs only
<div n="lb">in the Vedas. It is used very much in the same manner as
<div n="lb">{#अथ#} of which it is apparently a variety and corresponds
<div n="lb">chiefly with <sup>1</sup> Now, hereafter. <sup>2</sup> Moreover, so much the
<div n="lb">more. <sup>3</sup> Therefore. It occurs frequently in its protracted
<div n="lb">form {#अधा#} which seems to be the more original one. E.
<div n="lb">See {#अथ#}.
