{#अन्तरेण#}¦ ind. Used as an adverb and as preposition with the
accusative.
<div n="P">I. (adv.) In the middle.
<div n="P">II. (prepos.) 1. <sup>1</sup> Amidst. <sup>2</sup> During. <sup>3</sup> [With regard to,
on behalf of..?.] 2. <sup>1</sup> Without. <sup>2</sup> Except. [The comm. of
Pāṇini restrict the construction of {#अन्तरेण#} with the accus. to
the meanings {#‘मध्ये’#} and {#‘विना’#} rendered II. 1. 1. 2. and 2. 1. 2.,
thus excluding II. 1. 3. In conformity with this restriction
Bharata on Amarak. s. v. {#अन्तर#} instances {#तवान्तरेणर्णं गृ-#}
{#हीतम् = त्वदर्थम्#} &c. (not {#त्वामन्तरेण°#}), thus referring
{#अन्तरेण#} to the noun {#अन्तर,#} not to the preposition. It may
be observed, moreover, that in the only {%Sanskṛt%} passage
which is quoted in support of the meaning ‘on behalf of’
viz. Śakunt. in the beginning of the 5th act, {#‘तदस्या देवीं#}
{#वसुमतीमन्तरेण महदुपालम्भनं गतोऽस्मि’,#} the reading given
by the Calc. ed. and Chézy, but not noticed in its essential
portion by subsequent editions, viz. {#तदहं देवीं हंसवती-#}
{#मन्तरेण#} &c., would render the passage itself less obscure
than it is with the word {#वसुमती#} and allow {#अन्तरेण#} to retain
its legitimate construction in the sense ‘without’: ‘therefore,
being without the queen Hansavatī (the same as the {#हंस-#}
[Page123-b+ 56]
{#बदिआ#} named by Vidūṣaka, but omitted in the ed. of
Chézy, where the name of the queen is {#हंसवती#}) I have
incurred blame’. In another passage of the second act (ed.
Williams p. 81) {#भवन्तमन्तरेण#} is explained by one comm.
{#भवन्निमित्तम्#} but, in conformity with Pāṇini, by another
{#भवन्मध्ये;#} in the Calc. and Chézy's ed. the words are {#तुह#}
{#उबरि#} and the whole passage is Prākṛt. In some {%Prākṛt%}
passages of the dramas {#अन्तरेण#} has been used, however,
in this sense with the accus.] E. The native etym. {#अन्तर#}
and {#इ,#} kṛt aff. {#न#} is improbable; it is the instrum. of
{#अन्तर#} (Kaiyyaṭa calls it ‘a particle resembling a case’,
{#विभक्तिप्रतिरूपकस्तु निपातः#}). For the two categories of
the meanings v. s. v. {#अन्तर#}.
