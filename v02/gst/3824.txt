{#अन्तरेण#}¦ ind. Used as an adverb and as preposition with the
<div n="lb">accusative.
<div n="P">I. (adv.) In the middle.
<div n="P">II. (prepos.) 1. <sup>1</sup> Amidst. <sup>2</sup> During. <sup>3</sup> [With regard to,
<div n="lb">on behalf of..?.] 2. <sup>1</sup> Without. <sup>2</sup> Except. [The comm. of
<div n="lb">Pāṇini restrict the construction of {#अन्तरेण#} with the accus. to
<div n="lb">the meanings {#‘मध्ये’#} and {#‘विना’#} rendered II. 1. 1. 2. and 2. 1. 2.,
<div n="lb">thus excluding II. 1. 3. In conformity with this restriction
<div n="lb">Bharata on Amarak. s. v. {#अन्तर#} instances {#तवान्तरेणर्णं गृ-#}
<div n="lb">{#हीतम् = त्वदर्थम्#} &c. (not {#त्वामन्तरेण°#}), thus referring
<div n="lb">{#अन्तरेण#} to the noun {#अन्तर,#} not to the preposition. It may
<div n="lb">be observed, moreover, that in the only {%Sanskṛt%} passage
<div n="lb">which is quoted in support of the meaning ‘on behalf of’
<div n="lb">viz. Śakunt. in the beginning of the 5th act, {#‘तदस्या देवीं#}
<div n="lb">{#वसुमतीमन्तरेण महदुपालम्भनं गतोऽस्मि’,#} the reading given
<div n="lb">by the Calc. ed. and Chézy, but not noticed in its essential
<div n="lb">portion by subsequent editions, viz. {#तदहं देवीं हंसवती-#}
<div n="lb">{#मन्तरेण#} &c., would render the passage itself less obscure
<div n="lb">than it is with the word {#वसुमती#} and allow {#अन्तरेण#} to retain
<div n="lb">its legitimate construction in the sense ‘without’: ‘therefore,
<div n="lb">being without the queen Hansavatī (the same as the {#हंस-#}
[Page123-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">{#बदिआ#} named by Vidūṣaka, but omitted in the ed. of
<div n="lb">Chézy, where the name of the queen is {#हंसवती#}) I have
<div n="lb">incurred blame’. In another passage of the second act (ed.
<div n="lb">Williams p. 81) {#भवन्तमन्तरेण#} is explained by one comm.
<div n="lb">{#भवन्निमित्तम्#} but, in conformity with Pāṇini, by another
<div n="lb">{#भवन्मध्ये;#} in the Calc. and Chézy's ed. the words are {#तुह#}
<div n="lb">{#उबरि#} and the whole passage is Prākṛt. In some {%Prākṛt%}
<div n="lb">passages of the dramas {#अन्तरेण#} has been used, however,
<div n="lb">in this sense with the accus.] E. The native etym. {#अन्तर#}
<div n="lb">and {#इ,#} kṛt aff. {#न#} is improbable; it is the instrum. of
<div n="lb">{#अन्तर#} (Kaiyyaṭa calls it ‘a particle resembling a case’,
<div n="lb">{#विभक्तिप्रतिरूपकस्तु निपातः#}). For the two categories of
<div n="lb">the meanings v. s. v. {#अन्तर#}.
