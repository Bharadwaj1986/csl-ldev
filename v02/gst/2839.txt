{#अनुकर्षन्#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-र्षा#}) The bottom of a carriage. See {#अनुकर्ष#}.
E. Probably a further developement of the partic. {#अनुकर्षत्,#}
from {#कृष्#} with {#अनु,#} conformably to the general origin of bases
in {#अन्;#} the native dict. consider it as {#अनुकर्ष#} with an additional
{#न्,#} but {#अनुकर्ष#} is more likely the curtailed {#अनुकर्षन्#} as most
bases in {#अ#} probably originate in a fuller form on {#अस्, अत्, अन्#}.
