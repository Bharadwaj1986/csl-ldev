{#अपेहिकटा#}¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-टा#}) ? The correctness of the word
seems doubtful; it ought to be perhaps {#अपेहिकरटा,#} i. e. a
festival or ceremony where low people are denied admis-
sion. See the explanation s. v. {#अपेहिवाणिजा#}. E. {#अपेहि#}
(imper. of {#इ#} with {#अप#}) and {#कट#} (or perhaps {#करट#}), scil. {#क्रिया#}.
