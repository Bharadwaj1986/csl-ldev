{#अच्छ#}¦ I. m. f. n. ({#-च्छः-च्छा-च्छम्#}) Clear, transparent. See {#छ#}.
<div n="P">II. m. ({#-च्छः#}) <sup>1</sup> Crystal. <sup>2</sup> A bear (see {#ऋक्ष#}).
<div n="P">III. ind. (see {#निपात#}) A kind of preposition (or {#गति#} q. v.)
with the meaning of ‘to, unto, before, in front’, or ‘obtain-
ing, taking possession of’. Its use seems to be restricted
to the vaidik literature where it appears, for the most
part, in the protracted form {#अच्छा#}. It occurs only in con-
junction with verbs implying motion or speech--especially
with {#अज्, इ, गम्, या, नश्, नु, वा, वच्, वद्#}--either pre-
ceding or following them and requiring the noun which de-
pends upon this combination to stand in the accusative or in
[Page023-a+ 56]
the locative; the latter case, however, is only exceptional.--
The word is given also in the form {#अच्छम्#}. E. unknown.
That which is given is: {#अ#} neg. and {#छो,#} kṛt affix {#क,#}
‘not cutting or injuring sc. the sight’ and would refer
only to I. and to II. 1. in the sense of ‘not easily cut’.
