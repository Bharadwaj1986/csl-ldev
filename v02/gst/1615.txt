{#अदस्#}¦ I. m. f. n. ({#असौ-असौ-अदस्#}). The pronoun (see {#सर्व-#}
{#नामन्#}) which generally points to what is absent, remote
or uncertain (differently from {#इदम्#} q. v.) and which cor-
responds with <sup>1</sup> That. <sup>2</sup> A certain (so and so). In correlative
phrases it stands therefore usually in the prior sentence,
imparting greater emphasis. Its declension is defective in
as far as most of its cases are supplied by the themes {#असु#}
or {#अस, अमु (अमू)#} and {#अमि (अमी)#}. The theme which ap-
[Page047-b+ 56]
pears in composition is {#अदस्#} (except in the forms {#अद-#}
{#द्र्यञ्च्#} &c. q. v. See also {#अद्धा#}). In some derivations of rare
occurrence we meet also with the themes {#असु, अस#} and {#अमु;#}
see {#असुक, असक, अमुक#}.
<div n="P">II. ind. (esp. in composition with radicals (see {#गति#}),
when employed reflectively). So, in such a manner, f. i.
{#अदःकृत्य#} having done so &c.--In conjunction with a re-
lative pronoun or particle it has the effect of giving em-
phasis or of generalising, e. g. {#यददस्#} whatever, {#यत्रादस्#}
wherever, {#यथादस्#} howsoever. E. unknown; but it is pro-
bably derived from the theme {#अद्#} which occurs in {#अद-#}
{#द्र्यञ्च्#} and {#अद्धा#}.
