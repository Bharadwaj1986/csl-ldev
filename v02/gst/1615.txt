{#अदस्#}¦ I. m. f. n. ({#असौ-असौ-अदस्#}). The pronoun (see {#सर्व-#}
<div n="lb">{#नामन्#}) which generally points to what is absent, remote
<div n="lb">or uncertain (differently from {#इदम्#} q. v.) and which cor-
<div n="lb">responds with <sup>1</sup> That. <sup>2</sup> A certain (so and so). In correlative
<div n="lb">phrases it stands therefore usually in the prior sentence,
<div n="lb">imparting greater emphasis. Its declension is defective in
<div n="lb">as far as most of its cases are supplied by the themes {#असु#}
<div n="lb">or {#अस, अमु (अमू)#} and {#अमि (अमी)#}. The theme which ap-
[Page047-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">pears in composition is {#अदस्#} (except in the forms {#अद-#}
<div n="lb">{#द्र्यञ्च्#} &c. q. v. See also {#अद्धा#}). In some derivations of rare
<div n="lb">occurrence we meet also with the themes {#असु, अस#} and {#अमु;#}
<div n="lb">see {#असुक, असक, अमुक#}.
<div n="P">II. ind. (esp. in composition with radicals (see {#गति#}),
<div n="lb">when employed reflectively). So, in such a manner, f. i.
<div n="lb">{#अदःकृत्य#} having done so &c.--In conjunction with a re-
<div n="lb">lative pronoun or particle it has the effect of giving em-
<div n="lb">phasis or of generalising, e. g. {#यददस्#} whatever, {#यत्रादस्#}
<div n="lb">wherever, {#यथादस्#} howsoever. E. unknown; but it is pro-
<div n="lb">bably derived from the theme {#अद्#} which occurs in {#अद-#}
<div n="lb">{#द्र्यञ्च्#} and {#अद्धा#}.
