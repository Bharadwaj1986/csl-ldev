<div n="P">3. adv. ({#-ष्ठु#}) <sup>1</sup> Contrary, adversely. <sup>2</sup> Faultlessly, bla-
melessly. <sup>3</sup> Handsomely. [The {%Medinī%} has the meaning {#वाम;#}
the latter word however, compared to {#चारु#} of the {%Bhūri-%}
{%prayoga%} and to the meanings {#चारु#} and {#शोभन,#} for the ad-
verb., of {%Hemach.%} and the {%Med.,%} can scarcely be taken in
another sense than in that of ‘beautiful’; the meaning
‘ignorant, infantine’ rests on the authority of the {%Bhūripr.%}
and the {%Uṇṇādikoṣa%} which have the meaning {#बाल,#} the
[Page179-b+ 56]
former together with, the latter without, {#काल#}.--The form
of the adv. {#‘अपष्ठुम्’#} in the present ed. of the {%Śiśupālab.%}
15. 17. has been expressly mentioned, as if it were something
remarkable, but the mere scanning of the verse--without
any reference to Mss.--might have shown that it is a mis-
print, instead of {#अपष्ठु#}.] E. {#स्था#} with {#अप,#} uṇ. aff. {#कु#}.
