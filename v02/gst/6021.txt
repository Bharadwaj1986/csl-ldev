{#अभिधर्मपिटक#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-कः#}) ‘The basket of the revealed
truth’: the name of one of the three collections which com-
prise the sacred books of the Buddhists; (for the two others
[Page244-a+ 56]
see {#सूत्रपिटक#} and {#विनयपिटक#}); the instructions contained
in it were addressed by the Buddha to the Devas and
Brahmas of the celestial worlds (while those in the {%Sūtra-%}
{%piṭaka%} were addressed to the laity and those in the {%Vinayap.%}
to the priests); its redaction however is not ascribed to
Sākya Muni, but to his principal disciple {%Kāśyapa,%} the
chief of the first Buddhistic synod. It contains seven sections,
the text with 96, 250 stanzas, the commentaries with 30,000,
consisting, therefore, in the whole of 126,250 stanzas; its
best representative is the work called {%Prajnāpāramitā;%}
(comp. {%Spence Hardy'%}s {%East. Mon.%} p. 170 with the quot.
given there, and those s. v. {#अभिधर्म#}). E. {#अभिधर्म#} and {#पिटक#}.
