{#अप्सस्#}¦ n. ({#-प्सः#}) (ved.) The same as {#रूप;#} esp. form, beauty.
<div n="lb">E. {%Śākapūṇi,%} as quoted by {%Yāska,%} derives this word as a
<div n="lb">Tatpur. from {#अ#} neg. and {#प्सस्#} ({#प्सा,#} probably uṇ. aff.
<div n="lb">{#असुन्#}) and interprets it as meaning liter. ‘what ought to
<div n="lb">be looked upon ({#आदर्शनीय#})’ or ‘what ought to be diffused’
<div n="lb">i. e. manifest to sight {#‘व्यापनीयं वा स्पष्टं दर्शनाय’;#} but in
<div n="lb">the latter acceptation probably from {#अप्#} (comp. the E. of
<div n="lb">{#अप्त#}) and implying perhaps the meaning of {#ईप्सित#}.
