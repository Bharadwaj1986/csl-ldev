<L>5668<pc>224-b<k1>अप्सस्<k2>अप्सस्
{#अप्सस्#}¦ n. ({#-प्सः#}) (ved.) The same as {#रूप;#} esp. form, beauty.
E. {%Śākapūṇi,%} as quoted by {%Yāska,%} derives this word as a
Tatpur. from {#अ#} neg. and {#प्सस्#} ({#प्सा,#} probably uṇ. aff.
{#असुन्#}) and interprets it as meaning liter. ‘what ought to
be looked upon ({#आदर्शनीय#})’ or ‘what ought to be diffused’
i. e. manifest to sight {#‘व्यापनीयं वा स्पष्टं दर्शनाय’;#} but in
the latter acceptation probably from {#अप्#} (comp. the E. of
{#अप्त#}) and implying perhaps the meaning of {#ईप्सित#}.
