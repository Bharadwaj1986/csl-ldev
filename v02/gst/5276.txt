{#अपूर्व्य#}¦ I. (ved.) Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-व्यः-व्या-व्यम्#}) Not referring
to, not being in, not visible in, what is prior or has
existed before; e. g. {#उषस्,#} dawn, ‘since it is not seen in the
night-time which precedes it’; hence also: new, not made
or existed before, as hymns (‘which have never been com-
posed before’), or as Agni (as he is ever new through his
splendour’) &c. E. {#अ#} neg. and {#पूर्व्य#} (referring &c. to what
precedes or is prior).
<div n="P">II. m. f. n. ({#-र्व्यः-र्व्या-र्व्यम्#}) Worth of what has not existed
before, deserving what is extraordinary or excellent (viz.
the Soma-drink), an epithet of Vāyu (according to {%Sāyaṇa,%}
who explains the word in the {%Ṛgv.%} verse: {#त्वं नो वायवे-#}
{#षामपूर्व्यः सोमानां प्रथमः पीतिमर्हसि,#} in this way: {#न वि-#}
{#द्यते पूर्वं यस्मात्तत्पानमपूर्वम् । तदर्हतीत्यपूर्व्यः#}--comp. {%Pāṇ.%}
V. 1. 67.--; but as the word is udātta on the first syllable
the correctness of his interpretation, seems doubtful; the
word might well be, and have the meaning of, the Tatpur.
also in the quoted verse. E. {#अपूर्व,#} taddh. aff. {#यत्#}.
