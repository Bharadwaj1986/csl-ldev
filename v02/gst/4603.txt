{#अपद्#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-त्-त्-त्#}) (ved.) Going on a road
which does not exist or which is unknown. [In the passage
in which this word occurs, {%Śatap.%} XIV. 8. 15. 10., it is an
epithet of {#गायत्री,#} which for mystical reasons has been
called previously {#एकपदी#} ‘one-footed’, {#द्विपदी#} ‘two-footed’,
{#त्रिपदी#} ‘three-footed’ and {#चतुष्पदी#} ‘four-footed’; {%Dwiveda-%}
{%ganga%} on the {%Śatapathabr.%} explains {#अपद्#} ‘because a {#पद#} i. e.
by what she may be known does not exist’--{#पद्यसे ज्ञा-#}
{#यसे येन तत्पदं न विद्यते यस्याः सा त्वमपदसि#}--; but ac-
cording to this gloss {#अपद्#} would be a Bahuvr., while its
accent--the udātta on the first syllable--assigns it to
the class of Tatpur. compounds. The interpretation of {%Śan-%}
{%kara%} on the same passage in the {%Bṛhadār.%} seems therefore
preferable: {#अविद्यमानं पदं येन पद्यसे सा त्वमपदसि#} ‘thou
art {#अपद्#} because thou goest on a road which does not
exist or which is unknown’.--In no case can the word
[Page162-b+ 56]
mean ‘footless’, for its form would then be {#अपदी#} and its
accent the udātta on the penultima.--Bahuvr. forms
like {#अपदे, अपदी#} &c. belong to the base {#अपाद्#} q. v., not
to a base {#अपद्#}.] E. {#अ#} neg. and {#पद्#} (with an ellipsis of {#पद#}).
