{#अनुस्वार#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-रः#}) (In Grammar.) Literally, an after-
sound; the name of a nasal sound which always belongs to
the preceding vowel and according to some is weaker, ac-
cording to others stronger than the {#अनुनासिक#} q. v. In
writing it is marked by a dot over the vowel after which
it sounds. It shares in the nature as well of consonants as
of vowels: of consonants, in as much as it has but half a
measure of time (or {#मात्रा#}) and with another consonant
makes position: of vowels, by having their properties of
shortness, length, {#प्लुति#} q. v., and of being capable of ac-
centuation. (The vaidik grammarians call the consonants
and the Anusvāra the ‘body of a syllable’--{#अक्षराङ्ग#}--.)
On account of the organ of speech with which it is pro-
nounced it belongs to the {#नासिक्य#} q. v., and on account of
the mode in which it is uttered to the {#ऊष्मन्#} q. v. (see also
{#महाप्राण#}). If a combined consonant follows an Anusvāra
the vaidik grammarians want the first consonant of the group
to be repeated; e. g. {#सोमानं स्स्वरणं#} &c. instead of {#सोमानं#}
{#स्वरणं#} &c.; this rule, however, is neglected in most of our
vaidik Mss. and in all referring to the post-vaidik literature,
although the injunction of the grammarians is doubtless
founded on correct physiological observation and the system
of Sanskrit orthography on a correct imitation in writing
the spoken sound.--At the end of a {#पद#} (q. v.) Anu-
svāra is a substitute for {#म्,#} in the middle of a {#पद#} that of
{#म्#} or {#न्;#} at the end of a {#पद#} it is only allowed to occur
when the {#पद#} does not stand in a pause, and in the middle
not before any other sound than {#श्, ष्, स#} and {#ह्,#} before
which it is the compulsory substitute. (These rules, too,
are frequently neglected in spite of the grammatical author-
ities.) It is compulsory, too, at the end of the {#पद,#} before
the same letters and {#र्#} save a few exceptions as {#सम्राज्#} or
when {#ह्#} is followed by {#म्, न्#} &c., e. g. {#किं ह्मलयति#} or
{#किम्ह्मलयति, किं ह्नुते#} or {#किन्ह्नुते#} &c. For the interchange
and the confusion, that prevails in the classical literature,
between the use of Anusvāra and Anunāsika before {#य्,#}
{#ल्, व्#} see s. v. {#अनुनासिक#}.--A short syllable followed
by Anusvāra (which itself as results from the preceding
statement must always be followed by a consonant) becomes
of the nature of a long syllable, i. e. it becomes {#गुरु#} or
heavy; but though this is the constant case in the Vedas
[Page109-a+ 56]
and generally in the later literature, it will seem that this rule
may be departed from at the end of a Pāda, as in the instance
of the following first Pāda of the Āryā verse: {#अथ लुलितप-#}
{#तत्रिमालं रुग्नासनवाणकेशरतमालम्#} &c. where {#त्रिमालं#} counts
for ˘¯˘ |. ({#‘यद्यपि छन्दःशास्त्रे सानुस्वारस्य गुरुत्वमनुशिष्टं#}
{#तथापि तथा पादान्तगोऽपि वेति वचनात्तस्य लघुत्वात्प्रथम-#}
{#पादे द्वादश मात्रा भवन्ति’#}.) E. {#स्वृ#} with {#अनु,#} kṛt aff. {#घञ्#}.
