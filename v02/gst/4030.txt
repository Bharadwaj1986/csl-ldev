{#अन्द्(अदि-भ्वादि-उदात्त-उदात्तेत्)#}¦ r. 1st cl. par. ({#अन्दति-#}
{#अनात्-आनन्द;#} see {#अन्त्#}) To bind. (The Draviḍa pro-
vincialism of this radical is {#अन्त्#} q. v. Comp. also {#ईन्त्#}.
The real occurence of this radical which is inflected in the
Dhātuparāyaṇa of Hemachandra, as far as the forms given
are concerned, but not in the Dhātuvṛtti of Mādhava who
inflects {#अन्त्#} q. v., is very doubtful. See the Preface.)
