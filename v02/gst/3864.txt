{#अन्तर्धान#}¦ Tatpur. 1. n. ({#-नम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Concealment, covering.
<sup>2</sup> Disappearance, invisibility; also considered as one of the
forms assumed by Brahman (m.) in the process of creation,
according to the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. In the Yoga philo-
sophy it means the capacity of making himself inaccessible
to the senses, acquired by a Yogin through applying the
highest degree of meditation to the notions of Shape,
Sound &c.: {#कायरूपसंयमात्तद्ग्राह्यशक्तिस्तम्भे चक्षुःप्रकाशासंप्र-#}
{#योगे#} (v. 1. {#°शासंयोगे#}) {#ऽन्तर्धानम्#} ‘Disappearance arises
from {#संयम#} (the highest degree of meditation which com-
prises {#धारणा, ध्यान#} and {#समाधि#} qq. vv.) being applied to
Shape which inheres to Body, since thus the power (or
possibility) of being seized by that--viz. the eye--is
stopped and the clearness of vision has ceased to be’; this
[Page125-a+ 56]
definition, add the commentators, implies also that the
Yogin becomes inaccessible to the sense of ‘hearing &c.’
when the same meditation extends to the notion of
‘Sound &c.’
