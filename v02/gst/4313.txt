{#अन्यस्त्री#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-स्त्री#}) A woman not one's own. [In
<div n="lb">Rhetoric she is one of the three categories of the principal
<div n="lb">female character in a poetical composition (the two other
<div n="lb">being {#स्वस्त्री#} or {#स्वीया#} and {#साधारणस्त्री#} or {#सामान्यनायिका#}
<div n="lb">qq. vv.; the {#अन्यस्त्री#} or {#परकीया#} is either ‘another's wife’
<div n="lb">or a ‘damsel’; as ‘another's wife’ ‘she is fond of festivals
<div n="lb">and the like opportunities, is a disgrace to her family, bare
<div n="lb">of modesty’; the ‘damsel’ is ‘one not yet married, bashful
<div n="lb">and arrived at the period of youth’. Each of these two
<div n="lb">has again eight subdivisions; ‘she may be one who has an
<div n="lb">obsequious lover, or one who is ill-treated, or one who
<div n="lb">goes after her lover, or one who is separated from him by a
<div n="lb">quarrel, or one who is neglected, or one whose lover is abroad,
<div n="lb">or one who is prepared in her house to receive him, or one
<div n="lb">who is longing in absence of her lover’). E. {#अन्य#} and {#स्त्री#}.
