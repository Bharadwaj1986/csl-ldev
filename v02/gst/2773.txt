{#अनिशित#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-तः-ता-तम्#}) (ved.) Restless, incessant(?).
E. {#अनिशि#} (a denom. from {#अनिश#}), kṛt aff. {#क्त(?)#}. (Mean-
ing and etymology of this word are doubtful. According
to the native commentaries it would be a Tatpur. compounded
of {#अ#} neg. and {#निशित,#} sharpened, sharp, and would mean
either: <sup>1</sup> not sharp, not injurious, or: <sup>2</sup> not difficult, easy,
or <sup>3</sup> not slender, not little; but these explanations, when
applied to the passages to which they refer, seem artificial.
