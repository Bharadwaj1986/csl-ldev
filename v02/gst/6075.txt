{#अभिनिधान#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Placing over, putting over;
e. g. {%Kātyāy. Śrautas.:%} {#आयुरसीत्युत्तरयाज्यस्थालीं संस्पृश्य पु-#}
{#रूरवा इत्यभिनिधानं तया;#} ({%comm.%} {#उत्तरारण्या अधरारणे-#}
{#रुपरि निधानं करोति#}). <sup>2</sup> (In the {%Prātiśakhyas%}) Suppression
or weakening of a sound with regard to, or on account
of, scil. the influence of a preceding or following sound
[the qualification {%‘with regard to’%} or {%‘on account of’%} seems
to be implied by the prefix {#अभि#}], viz. <sup>a.</sup> the suppression
of the vowel {#अ#} through the influence of a {%preceding%} {#ओ#} or
{#ए#} (comp. {#अभिनिहित#}); e. g. in {#गाहमानोऽदयः#} of the word
{#अदयः,#} or in {#वालेऽवत#} of the word {#अवत;#} <sup>b.</sup> the sup-
pression or weakening of the sound or of the vibration of
the voice which naturally follows the pronunciation of a
consonant, if such a consonant is {%followed%} by, and has made
{%sandhi%} with, another consonant; according to the {%Ṛgv.%}
{%Prātiś.,%} such a sound or the vibration of the voice is {%sup-%}
{%pressed,%} if the consonant is surd ({#क, च#} &c.); it is {%weakened,%}
if the consonant is sonant ({#ग, ज#} &c.) and the sound which
{%remains,%} after such weakening is called {#ध्रुव#} (q. v.). This
suppression or weakening of the vibration of the voice,
however, takes place only under the following restrictions:
1. in the pronunciation of a {#स्पर्श#} or {#अन्तःस्था#} (except {#र्#}),
[Page248-a+ 56]
if it is followed by a {#स्पर्श;#} e. g. in {#अर्वाग्देवः#} or in {#उल्काम्;#}
2. of a {#स्पर्श,#} if it stands in a pause; e. g. in {#वाक्;#} 3. of an
{#अन्तःस्था,#} if it is followed by another similar {#अन्तःस्था;#}
e. g. in {#तव्वंँः;#} 4 of {#ल्,#} if it is followed by an {#ऊष्मन्;#} e. g.
in {#शतवल्शः;#} 5. of {#क्#} in {#अक्ख्यत्;#} 6. of {#प्#} in {#विरप्सी;#} 7. of
a {#स्पर्श#} except {#म्#} (i. e. {#क्#} till {#भ्#}), if it is followed by {#य्,#}
{#र्, व्#} or an {#ऊष्मन्;#} e. g. in {#यद्यत्, तद्रासभः, यान्वः, अर्वा-#}
{#क्शफौ;#} (the latter cases 4-7. only in the theory of the {%Śā-%}
{%kalas%}). These general rules are subject to exceptions and
restrictions, and even as such they are not universally re-
cognized; {%Śaunaka,%} for instance, says, that {%Vyāĺi%} does not
recognize the {#अभिनिधान,#} {%in general,%} and admits of it only
when the following consonant is doubled or if a vowel or
{#र्#} precede.--The {%Vājas. Prātiś.%} uses instead of the term
{#अभिनिधान#} the explanation {#स्थानकरणविमोक्षः#} ‘giving up
the characteristics of a consonant, viz. the organic dis-
tinction and the distinction with regard to the effort of pro-
nunciation’; (comp. the list in {%Pāṇ.%} I. 1. 9. where {#करण#}
answers the {#प्रयत्न;#} and see {%Weber'%}s ed. of this {%Prātiś. Ind.%}
{%Stud.%} IV. p. 127), but applies it merely to the {#स्पर्श#} at the
end of a word, if it is followed by another word, and in
a pause.--The {%Atharvav. Prātiś.%} (quoted by {%Weber 1. c.,%}
where the {%masc.%} {#अभिनिधानः#} seems to be an error of the
Berlin Ms.) admits the {#अभिनिधान#} only 1. of a {#स्पर्श,#} if it
is followed by a {#स्पर्श,#} 2. of a {#स्पर्श#} at the end of a word or
at an {#अवग्रह,#} 3. of {#ल्#} before an {#ऊष्मन्,#} 4 of {#ङ्, ण, न,#}
before {#ह्#}. {%Śākalya,%} in the cases 4-7. mentioned above, and
the {%Atharvav. Prātiś.%} in its enumeration do not consider
two consonants, the first of which suffers the {%abhinidhāna,%}
as {#संयुक्त#} or combined consonants ({%Śaunaka:%} {#असंयुक्तं शा-#}
{#कलम्;#} {%Atharvav. Pr.:%} {#अतोऽन्यत्संयुक्तम् ‘संयुक्त#} is a com-
bination of consonants other than that in the preceding
cases’); i. e. they assume such a stoppage of the voice as
to prevent two consonants to sound together; but {%Śaunaka%}
does not seem to go so far, for he quotes {%Śākalya%} apparently
for the sake of recording his dissent from the opinion of
the latter. The distinction is probably owing to the dif-
ference in the observation, by the different grammarians,
of the phenomena of pronunciation; the supposition of {%Mr.%}
{%Regnier%} ({%Journ. Asiat.%} 1857, p. 230), that there is a twofold
{%abhinidhāna,%} the one applying to the consonantic groups
which are the {%natural%} effect of the sandhi, the other to such
groups as are produced by the {%krama,%} is very ingenious,
but does not necessarily follow from the text of this {%Prātiś.%}
(I. 1. 6. and 7.); for similar differences of opinion in the theory
on the pronunciation of consonantic groups, arising ob-
viously from different observations, may be gathered also
from the Sūtras of Pāṇini. [In the preceding explanation
the term {#स्पर्श#} comprises the 25 consonants {#क-ङ, च-ञ,#}
{#ट-ण, त-न#} and {#प-म;#} the term {#ऊष्मन्#} (q. v.) the sibi-
lants {#ह, श, ष, स;#} and the semivowels {#य, र, ल, व#} are
termed {#अन्तःस्था,#} because their position in the system of
the vaidik gramm. is between the {#स्पर्श#} and {#ऊष्मन्;#} (s. v.
{#अन्तःस्था#} p. 117{%a,%} 1. 49 the words ‘vowels and consonants’
are a mistake for ‘{#स्पर्श#} and {#ऊष्मन्#}’).] E. {#धा#} with {#नि#} and
{#अभि,#} kṛt aff. {#ल्युट्#}.
