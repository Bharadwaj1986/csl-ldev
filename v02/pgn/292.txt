16. {%Śaṃkara%}¦ (No. 22, L. 6):
It is the name of a Jaina monk<sup>46</sup>, who installed an image
of Pārśvanātha. Literally meaning ‘causing prosperity’, it is
one of the common names of Lord Śiva.<sup>47</sup> The present case
goes against the traditions of the Smṛtis which forbid the
giving of the names of deities directly to human beings.
