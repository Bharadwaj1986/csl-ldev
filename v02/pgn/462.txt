5. {%Paraspatikā%}¦ (No. 37, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>It seems to be the name of a locality. The metathesis of two
<div n="lb"/>letters ‘s’ and ‘p’ seems to have worked here. Its correct
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit form should have been ‘Parapastikā’. The word
<div n="lb"/>‘prapasti’ means a house, habitation or abode.<sup>675</sup>
