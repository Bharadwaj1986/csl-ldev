1. {%Kumārabhava%}¦ (No. 43, L. 5):
Kumāra is another name of Skanda or Kārttikeya<sup>4</sup> and Bhava is
the name of Lord Śiva. So it is also a name formed by combining
the names of two deities. We find several names with Kumāra
as the first word. Cf. Kumārasvāmin, Kumārahārīta, Kumāra-
bhaṭṭa<sup>5</sup>
