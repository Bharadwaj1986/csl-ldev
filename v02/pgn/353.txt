 {%Pradeśa%}¦
Fleet translates it as ‘place’<sup>161</sup> but the term has a speci-
fic use as an administrative division. Here it connotes a divi-
sion<sup>162</sup> or may correspond with the word viṣaya used in the
same context in the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Tora-
māṇa.<sup>163</sup> In modern usage pradeśa signifies a province.
<div n="P"/>In our inscriptions we find only one place-name termed as
Pradeśa.
