KUṆḌADANTA¦. A Videha brahmin, Kuṇḍadanta
gave up his worldly possession for the attainment
of spiritual knowledge, and sought the help of sage
Kadamba. Finding that he had not yet completely
mastered the senses Kadamba sent him to Ayodhyā,
where he lived with Śrī Rāma, and Vasiṣṭha taught
him the necessary texts on the subject so that he
attained spiritual knowledge. (Yogavāsiṣṭha).
