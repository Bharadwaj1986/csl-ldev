GARUḌAPURĀṆA¦. One of the eighteen Mahāpurāṇas.
This is believed to be a narration to Garuḍa by
Mahāviṣṇu. There are eight thousand ślokas in it.
There is an opinion that only the Tārkṣyakalpa is of
Viṣṇu. The theme of the Purāṇa is the birth of Garuḍa
from Brahmāṇḍa. If this Purāṇa is given as a gift it
should be given along with the image of a swan in
gold. (Chapter 272, Agni Purāṇa).
