AGNIŚAUCA¦(M). A cloak with magical properties
given to Nala by the serpent, Kārkoṭaka. After separat-
ing himself from Damayantī, Nala was wandering in
the forest. Then he was bitten by the poisonous serpent,
Kārkoṭaka. This deformed Nala beyond recognition.
Then the serpent gave him this shawl (Agniśauca).
Anybody who wore that cloak would regain his original
form and colour. (Kathāsaritsāgara-Alaṅkāravatī-lam-
baka-Taraṅga 6).
