ŚYĀPARṆA¦(S). A priestly community. They were
the priests of King Viśvantara. Once Viśvantara decided
to perform a Somayāga. Without allowing Śyāparṇas
to take part in that yāga, the King invited other priests
for the purpose. At that time, Rāmabhārgaveya, one of
the Śyāparṇas devised a new method concerning Soma-
yāga and established his claim to priesthood. (Aitareya
Brāhmana, 7, 27).
