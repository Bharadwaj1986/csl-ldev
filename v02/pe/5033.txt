PARAŚUVANA¦. A forest in hell. The sinners after
climbing out of Vaitaraṇī, a river in hell in which hot
blood flows, reach Asipatravana. There the bodies of
the sinners are cut by the leaves of asipatra which are
as sharp as a sword's edge. Leaving that they reach
Paraśuvana. (Sloka 32, Chapter 322, Śānti Parva).
