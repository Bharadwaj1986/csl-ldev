ARUṆODĀ¦. A river flowing through the island of
Plakṣa, one of the seven islands of ancient times. The
wind around ten yojanas of Plakṣa is very fragrant
because it carries the divine fragrance being emitted
always from the bodies of Pārvatī and her attendants,
who drink water from river Aruṇodā. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Aṣṭama Skandha).
