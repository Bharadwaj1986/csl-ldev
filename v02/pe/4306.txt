MĀṆḌAVYA¦. A sage. He is known as Aṇīmāṇḍavya
also. Once Rāvaṇa beat Māṇdavya because of his
not respecting Rāvaṇa. That day Māṇḍavya cursed
him saying “You will also be beaten like this by a
brave monkey”. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
(More details can be had from the entry Aṇīmāṇḍa-
vya). The āśrama of Māṇḍavya is considered a holy
place. Once the King of Kāśī went to this āśrama and
performed severe penance there. (Chapter 186, Udyoga
Parva).
