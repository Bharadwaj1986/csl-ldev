KĪRTIMUKHA¦. A Śiva gaṇa born out of the matted
hair of Śiva with three faces, three tails, three legs and
seven hands. The Lord at first asked him to live on
corpses, but later on, in appreciation of his valour
granted him the boon that if anyone saw the Lord
without thinking first about Kīrtimukha, he would
meet with his down-fall. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara
Khaṇḍa, Chapter 50).
