VIṢṆUJVARA¦. A great disease used by people to defeat
<div n="lb"/>their enemies. The antidote for Viṣṇujvara is Śiva-
<div n="lb"/>jvara. In ancient days, in the fight between Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Bāṇa, Śivajvara was sent against Śrī Kṛṣṇa by
<div n="lb"/>Bāṇa and to prevent it Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent Viṣṇujvara
<div n="lb"/>against Bāṇa. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
