JĀBĀLI IV¦. A hermit. The intensive penance of this
hermit compelled Indra to depute the celestial maid
Rambhā to hinder it. Jābāli became a prey to the entice-
ment of this heavenly beauty and a daughter was born
to them. This damsel was carried away by the King
Citrāṅgada. The hermit Jābāli cursed Citrāṅgada to
become a leper. (Skanda Purāṇa. Chapters 3, 143,
and 144).
