VAJRABĀHU I¦. A notorious asura. Vajrabāhu was
born of a Vidyādhara-damsel named Cañcalākṣī, when
she was raped by the asura Sahasramukha. This
Vajrabāhu did penance before Śiva and obtained Pāśu-
patāstra (a divine arrow) and an impenetrable armour.
After this, he caught hold of Indra and bound him.
Subrahmaṇya rescued Indra and killed Vajrabāhu.
(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa).
