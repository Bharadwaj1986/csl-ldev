CŪLI¦. A sage. Once Somadā, daughter of a gandharva
women Ūrmilā, looked after this sage and well pleased
with her service he asked her what she wanted and
Somadā asked for a son by him. Cūli gave her a spiri-
tual son of his and the boy was named Brahmadatta.
This Brahmadatta married the hundred hunch-backed
daughters of Kuśanābha. (Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa).
