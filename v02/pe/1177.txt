BHOṢA¦. A word meaning a comic, stupid or eccentric
person. Bhoṣas are of eight kinds. Those who feel
derided, those who babble, those who are obstinate,
sophists, those who indulge in hollow laughter, those
who pretend to be blind, those who pretend to be deaf,
and those who try to assert their self-importance—these
are the eight classes of “Bhoṣas”.
