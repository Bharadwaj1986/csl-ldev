VIJITĀŚVA¦. One of the five sons of emperor Pṛthu.
Vijitāśva decided to perform one hundred horse-
sacrifices and completed ninetynine. Seeing this Indra
feared that he might be deposed. So he stealthily took
away the sacrificial horse of Vijitāśva.
<div n="NI"/>There was a fierce battle between Indra and Vijitāśva
in which Indra was defeated, and Vijitāśva recovered
the stolen horse from Indra. It was from that day on-
wards that this son of Pṛthu got the name Vijitāśva.
Being pleased with the King at this expert fighting,
Devendra taught him the art of vanishing. (Bhāgavata.
Skandha 4).
