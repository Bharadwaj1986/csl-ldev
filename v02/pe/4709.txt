NAMUCI III¦. Another valiant captain of Hiraṇyākṣa.
He sent five arrows against Indra in a fierce battle. But
Indra cut all the five arrows in the midway. Then by
his magic and sorcery Namuci spread darkness every-
where. Indra defeated that strategy also. Then Namuci
dashed forward and taking hold of the tusks of Airāvata
shook Indra down. Indra stood up and cut off the head
of Namuci with his sword. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi
Khaṇḍa).
