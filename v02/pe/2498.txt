GOVINDADATTA¦. A brahmin of great fame who
resided in Bahusuvarṇaka, a city on the banks of the
river Gaṅgā. His wife was a very pious woman. They
had five children. Once when both the parents were
away from the house a sage called Vaiśvānara came
there but the children did not receive him and treat
him properly. Knowing this Govindadatta abandoned
all his children. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭhalaṃ-
baka).
