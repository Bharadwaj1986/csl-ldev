MANDARĀ¦. One of the wives of Viśvakarmā. The
<div n="lb"/>monkey named Nala was the son of Mandarā. This
<div n="lb"/>monkey was the chief of those who helped Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>to build a bridge to Laṅkā. Viśvakarmā had once
<div n="lb"/>blessed Mandarā saying that her son would one day
<div n="lb"/>become great. (Sarga 22, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
