KĀLEYA¦(S). A set of Asuras born to the great sage
Kaśyapa of his wife Kālā. Some scholars hold the view
that the Kālakeyas and the Kāleyas are one and the
same. Kāleyas destroyed the Āśramas of sages like Va-
siṣṭha, Cyavana and Bharadvāja. (Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 102). Devas killed some of the Kāleyas; the others
ran away to Pātāla.
