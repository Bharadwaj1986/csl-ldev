MATSYAPURĀṆA¦. One of the eighteen Purāṇas. This
Purāṇa was told to Manu Satyavrata by Mahāviṣṇu
during his incarnation as Matsyu. There are thirteen
thousand ślokas in it. For prosperity this Purāṇa should
be given as gift on the Viṣuvat day along with a golden
image of Matsya. (Chapters 2 and 272, Agni Purāṇa).
