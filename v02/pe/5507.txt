PŪRṆABHADRA II¦. The son of a Yakṣa called
Ratnabhadra living on the mountain Gandhamādana.
He had a son named Harikeśa (Piṅgala). Harikeśa was
a devotee of Śiva and so Pūrṇabhadra who was a
devotee of Kubera sent Harikeśa away from his house.
Harikeśa was then taken care of by Śiva and made one
of his attendants. (Matsya Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
