KAUṆḌINYA III¦. A hermit. This hermit had erected his
hermitage in Hastimatīsabhramatīsaṅgama and lived
there. Once due to excess of rain the river flooded and
his hermitage was washed away. So the hermit cursed
the river. “Let the river be dried up”. Then he went
to the realm of Vaikuṇṭha. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara
Khaṇḍa, Chapter 145).
