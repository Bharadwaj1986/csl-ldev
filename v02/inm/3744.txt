[{@Duḥśalotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“birth of Duḥśalā”). § 181 (Sam-
bhavap.): That {%Gāndhārī%} also had a daughter ({%Duḥśalā%}) was
due to the circumstance that Vyāsa, when he divided the
lump of flesh (knowing that {%Gāndhārī%} wished to have a
daughter), assigned one part in excess of the hundred to
become a daughter (I, {@116@}).
