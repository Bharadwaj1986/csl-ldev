[{@Indrajidvadha(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the slaughter of Indrajit”).
§ 541: Indrajit tied Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in a network of
those arrows of his which he had obtained as boons. Sugrīva
and the monkeys Suṣeṇa, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), surrounded them. Vibhī-
ṣaṇa came and roused them with the Prajñāstra; Sugrīva
extracted the arrows and applied the medicine {%viśalyā%}; from
the mountain Śveta a Guhyaka of Kubera's brought water,
by rubbing one's eyes with which all invisible creatures
became visible. Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), rubbed
their eyes. Having informed Rāvaṇa, Indrajit returned
without having completed his daily sacrifice; receiving a
hint from Vibhīṣaṇa, Lakṣmaṇa killed Indrajit. Rāvaṇa
would kill Sītā, but was dissuaded by Avindhya (III, {@289@}).
