slaughter, his resolution to continue the battle, his making
{%Śalya%} the commander of the army; that {%Śalya%}, having made
a great carnage, was slain by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at midnight; that
{%Duryodhana%} fled away from the field, penetrated into a lake,
and in the afternoon was summoned and slain by {%Bhīmasena%},
who had caused the lake to be encompassed by many warriors;

the night; that {%Sañjaya%}, next morning, having set out from
the camp, entered the city; the grief of the citizens upon
hearing {%Duryodhana's%} fall; that {%Sañjaya%} informed {%Dhṛta-%}

the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} 3”) (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>); {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), grief;
that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} ordered {%Vidura%} to let the ladies and
{%Gāndhārī%} retire, and was comforted by {%Vidura%} (IX, {@1@});
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} lament and how he asked {%Sañjaya%} about the
battle (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) (IX, {@2@}). {%Sañjaya%} begins his narration.—§ 610:
The fear of the {%Kurus%} after the fall of {%Karṇa%}, and the
state of the {%Kuru%} army (<lang n="greek">η</lang>); {%Duryodhana's%} resolution to
resist the victors (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>); {%Bhīma%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} caused
[Page190-b+ 63]
a great carnage; {%Arjuna%} proceeded towards the car-division;
{%Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), & {%Śakuni%}; 25,000 foot-soldiers & {%Arjuna%};
they were slain by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna (b%}) and {%Bhīma%}; the {%Kuru%}
army broke and fled away; {%Cekitāna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), having slain
a large number, blew their conchs; {%Arjuna%} attacked the
rest; they fled; {%Duryodhana%} & the {%Pāṇḍavas; Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} rallied his troops (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>); {%Duryodhana%} (+ all his troops)
& the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}) (IX, {@3@}). {%Kṛpa%}
urged {%Duryodhana%} to make peace (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>) (IX, {@4@}); {%Duryodhana%}
refused (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>). The troops were filled with enthusiasm; they
took up their quarters about two yojanas distant, and bathed
in the {%Sarasvatī%} of red waters on the sacred and beautiful
tableland at the foot of {%Himavat%} (IX, {@5@}); there they passed
the night: {%Śalya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), and urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to continue
the battle. {%Duryodhana%} addressed {%Aśvatthāman%} (description)
(<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), according to whose proposal {%Śalya%} was made genera-
lissimo (<lang n="greek">π</lang>) (IX, {@6@}); {%Śalya%} promised to slay the foes (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>).
{%Śalya%} was anointed; the troops became cheerful (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>). {%Śalya%}
resolved to slay or be slain (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>). No one any longer felt any
grief on account of {%Karṇa%}; they slept that night happily
and became very cheerful. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} his
advice (<lang n="greek">υ</lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%} praised {%Śalya (Ārtāyani%}), saying that he
was equal to {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>), and superior to {%Śikhaṇḍin%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>); he thought only {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was a match for
{%Śalya%}, and urged him to slay him. After {%Kṛṣṇa%} had gone,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} dismissed all his brothers and the {%Somakas%} and
slept happily that night, and so did the {%Pāñcālas%} and the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, delighted with {%Karṇa's%} fall (IX, {@7@}).—§ 611:
THE BATTLE OF THE FORENOON OF THE EIGHTEENTH DAY.
After that night had passed away, the {%Kuru%} army, urged by
{%Duryodhana%}, prepared for battle; the leaders, {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>),
resolved to fight unitedly (“or be stained with the five great
sins and all the minor sins”). Then, with {%Śalya%} at their
head, they quickly proceeded against the foes. Similarly,
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. Asked by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} about {%Śalya's%}
slaughter by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Duryodhana's%} by {%Bhīmasena%},
{%Sañjaya%} related: {%Śalya%} proceeded with horses of the {%Sindhu%}
breed yoked unto his chariot, at the head of the array, accom-
panied by the {%Madrakas%} and the sons of {%Karṇa%}; enumeration of
warriors on the left (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), on the right (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), in the rear (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), in the
centre (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); {%Śakuni%} and {%Ulūka%} surrounded by a large force of
cavalry, etc. The mighty bowmen amongst the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
divided themselves into three bodies, and rushed against the
{%Kurus; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), against the army of {%Śalya%};
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his troops against {%Śalya%} alone; {%Arjuna%}
against {%Kṛtavarman%} and the {%Saṃśaptakas; Bhīmasena%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>),
against {%Kṛpa; Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%} against {%Śakuni%} and
{%Ulūka%}. Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} enumerated the
relative strength of the two armies (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>) (IX, {@8@}). The
commencement of the battle (description); a terrible slaughter
on both sides. {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīmasena%} stupefied their foes;
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), & {%Śalya; Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%}
proceeded with speed; the {%Kurus%} fled away (IX, {@9@}). {%Śalya%}
{%& Yudhiṣṭhira%} (+ the {%Pāṇḍava%} host); {%Nakula & Karṇa's%} son
{%Citrasena%}, whom he slew; {%Nakula & Citrasena's%} brothers
{%Satyasena%} and {%Suṣeṇa; Nakula%} slew {%Satyasena%}, mounted
the chariot of {%Sutasoma%}, and slew {%Suṣeṇa%}. The {%Kurus%}
were rallied by {%Śalya%}; a great slaughter took place on both
sides. {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), roared like lions, etc. The
{%Kurus%} surrounded {%Śalya%}; thither came {%Arjuna%}, having
slaughtered the {%Saṃśaptakas%}, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} headed by
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (IX, {@10@}). {%Śalya%} fought with great heroism
against the troops of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; portents appeared on
[Page191-a+ 63]
earth and in the skies. {%Śalya & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>);
many were slain; the {%Pāṇḍava%} army repaired to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%};
{%Kṛtavarman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), & {%Bhīmasena%}, etc.; {%Kṛtavarman &%}
{%Bhīmasena; Kṛpa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Śakuni &%} the {%Draupa-%}
{%deyas; Aśvatthāman &%} the twins; {%Duryodhana & Kṛṣṇa%} and
{%Arjuna%}; the {%Bhoja%} chief slew the brown steeds of {%Bhīmasena%};
{%Śalya%} slew the steeds of {%Sahadeva%}, who then slew {%Śalya's%} son;
{%Kṛpa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Aśvatthāman &%} the {%Draupadeyas%};
once more the steeds of {%Bhīmasena%} were slain; he crushed
the steeds and chariot of {%Kṛtavarman%}, who fled away; {%Śalya &%}
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>); {%Bhīma%} (with his mace, with which he
had challenged {%Kubera%} and slain Gh. on Gandhamādana) &
{%Śalya%} (IX, {@11@}); “save {%Śalya%} or {%Rāma%} (the delighter of the
{%Yadus%}), none else can venture to encounter {%Bhīma%}; save
{%Bhīma%}, none can venture to encounter {%Śalya”; Kṛpa%} taking
up {%Śalya%} on his own chariot, bore him away; {%Bhīma%} had also
been made senseless. The {%Kurus%} (headed by {%Duryodhana%}) &
the {%Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana & Cekitāna; Kṛpa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), &
{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Aśvatthāman%}
(with 3,000 chariots, despatched by {%Duryodhana%}) & {%Arjuna%};
{%Śalya + Candrasena + Drumasena & Yudhiṣṭhira%} + 25 {%Cedis%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was worsted (IX, {@12@}). {%Sātyaki%} and
{%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>) ({%+ Yudhiṣṭhira) & Śalya%}; Si., etc., were
delighted; {%Duryodhana%} regarded the {%Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas%}, and
{%Sṛñjayas%} as already slain; the {%Pāṇḍavas & Śalya%}, who agitated
the whole {%Pāṇḍava%} army; D. and G. wondered; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
with {%Bhīmasena%} at their head and led by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} did not
fly (IX, {@13@}). {%Arjuna & Aśvatthāman%} and the {%Trigartas; Arjuna%}
destroyed 2,000 chariots; {%Aśvatthāman%} & the {%Pāñcāla Suratha%},
whom he slew; {%Aśvatthāman%} and the {%Saṃśaptakas & Arjuna%}
(IX, {@14@}). {%Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Śikhaṇḍin%} + the
{%Prabhadrakas & Kṛtavarman%} and {%Kṛpa; Śalya &%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(with {%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), and {%Sātyaki%}); {%Nakula + Yudhiṣṭhira%}
{%& Śalya; Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>), {%& Śalya; Śalya & Bhīmasena%}
{%+ Sātyaki%} (whom he deprived of his chariot); {%Sātyaki%} (on
another chariot) & {%Śalya%} (IX, {@15@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} (in the
very sight of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}, and though checked by
{%Bhīmasena%}) were afflicted by the {%Kurus%} (headed by {%Śalya%}).
{%Arjuna & Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman; Sahadeva & Śakuni; Nakula%}
cast glances on {%Śalya%} from the side; the {%Draupadeyas%} checked
numerous kings; {%Śikhaṇḍin & Aśvatthāman; Bhīmasena &%}
{%Duryodhana; Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Śalya%} alone fought with
the whole {%Pāṇḍava%} army; {%Śalya & Bhīma%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} fled,
disregarding the cries of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who, summoning all
his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, declared that after {%Bhīṣma%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>), had been slain, {%Śalya%} only remained as his
share; the sons of {%Mādrī%} should be the protectors of
his wheels; {%Sātyaki%} would protect his right wheel and
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} his left, {%Arjuna%} his rear, {%Bhīma%} fight
in his front. The {%Pāṇḍava%} troops rejoiced, especially
the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Bhīma &%}
{%Duryodhana; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">υ</lang>), & {%Śakuni%}, etc.;
{%Duryodhana%} was borne away by his steeds; {%Aśvatthāman%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>), followed him in order to rescue him; the {%Kaurava%}
troops became terrified; {%Arjuna%} began to slay them; {%Śalya%}
was worsted by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; the army of {%Duryodhana%}
broke; {%Aśvatthāman%}, taking {%Śalya%} up on his own chariot,
fled away; {%Śalya%} (on another chariot) & {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (IX,
{@16@}) + {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>); the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψ</lang>), & {%Śalya%}; the
{%Kurus%} surrounded {%Śalya%} at the command of {%Duryodhana%};
{%Kṛpa%} slew {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} charioteer, and {%Śalya%} his steeds;
{%Bhīmasena%} slew {%Śalya's%} charioteer and steeds and cut off his
armour; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ω</lang>), & {%Śalya; Yudhiṣṭhira%}
[Page191-b+ 63]
slew {%Śalya%} with a celestial dart (created by {%Tvaṣṭṛ%} for the
use of {%Īśāna%}, and always worshipped by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
perfumes and garlands and excellent seats and the best
kinds of viands and drinks). {%Śalya's%} younger brother &
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who slew him; the {%Kurus%} broke; {%Sātyaki%}
{%& Kṛtavarman%}, whom {%Kṛpa%} carried away on his chariot;
{%Duryodhana%} alone withstood the {%Pāṇḍava%} leaders (<lang n="greek">αα</lang>);
{%Kṛtavarman%} (on another chariot) + {%Kṛpa & Yudhiṣṭhira%};
{%Kṛtavarman%} was carried away by {%Aśvatthāman%} upon the
latter's chariot; {%Kṛpa & Yudhiṣṭhira%}. The {%Pārthas%} blew
their conchs and applauded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (IX, {@17@}). The
followers of {%Śalya%} (1,700 {%Madrakas%}) resolved to avenge him;
{%Duryodhana%} commanded them not to proceed to battle; they,
however, attacked {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ββ</lang>), & the
{%Madrakas%}, whom they began to slaughter; {%Duryodhana%} in
vain tried to prevent them from fighting; then, urged by
{%Śakuni%}, he proceeded to the rescue of the {%Madrakas%}. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} arranged themselves in the form called {%Madhyama%}
and slew the {%Madrakas%}; meteors, etc., were seen; the {%Pārthas%}
encountered a body of horse advancing towards them; the
{%Kuru%} army fled away (IX, {@18@}). Also the sons of {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%} almost all turned away from the fight at noon;
their fear was like to that after the fall of {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γγ</lang>);
the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} pursued them, and congratulated
one another (<lang n="greek">δδ</lang>). The {%Sṛñjayas%} pursued the {%Kurus; Arjuna%}
& the chariot-division; {%Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">εε</lang>), & {%Śakuni. Duryodhana%}
rallied 21,000 foot-soldiers, resisted by {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Dhṛṣ-%}
{%ṭadyumna; Bhīma%} slew them; {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} troops in vain
tried to transgress {%Duryodhana. Duryodhana%} rallied a small
force by a spirited address (<lang n="greek">ζζ</lang>); the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, especially
{%Arjuna%}, rushed against them; {%Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ηη</lang>), against {%Śakuni%}
(IX, {@19@}). The {%Mleccha%} king {%Śālva%} (on an elephant, sprung
from a noble breed, and always worshipped by {%Duryodhana%})
attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (+ {%Somakas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%}), who fled;
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (in order to vanquish the elephant) & {%Śālva%};
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} had his chariot, steeds, and charioteer destroyed
by the elephant; {%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θθ</lang>), & {%Śālva%} (+ the elephant);
the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ιι</lang>), lamented; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} slew the
elephant with his mace, and {%Sātyaki%} slew {%Śālva%} (IX, {@20@}).
{%Kṛtavarman%}, rallying a portion of the {%Kuru%} army, resisted
the {%Pāṇḍavas; Sātyaki%} & king {%Kṣemakīrti%}, whom he slew;
{%Kṛtavarman & Sātyaki%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc.,
became spectators; {%Kṛpa%} carried {%Kṛtavarman%} away upon his
chariot; the whole army of {%Duryodhana%} fled except {%Duryodhana%},
who assailed all the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κκ</lang>); then {%Kṛtavarman%} came
(on another chariot) (IX, {@21@}). {%Duryodhana%} alone resisted
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; the {%Kuru%} army once more rallied and fought;
{%Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λλ</lang>); {%Aśvatthāman & Bhīma-%}
{%sena; Śakuni & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who was carried away by
{%Sahadeva%} on his chariot; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (on another chariot) &
{%Śakuni%}; Si. and Cā. applauded; {%Ulūka & Nakula; Kṛta-%}
{%varman & Sātyaki; Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Kṛpa &%}
the {%Draupadeyas%} (IX, {@22@}). The {%Kurus%} were broken by the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, but rallied by the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira & Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} (who was carried away by
{%Aśvatthāman%}); {%Duryodhana%} despatched 700 chariots against
{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc., came to aid {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; an
awful battle ensued; the 700 were slain; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
{%Pāñcālas%} resisted; terrifying omens in nature were seen.
{%Śakuni%} exhorted the others to fight in front; he would
himself slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} from behind; the {%Madrakas%}
rejoiced, but were slain; {%Śakuni%} with 10,000 horsemen
assailed the {%Pāṇḍava%} army in the rear; the force of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
[Page192-a+ 63]
broke down. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged {%Sahadeva%} to slay {%Śakuni%},
aided by the {%Draupadeyas; Yudhiṣṭhira%}, with the {%Pāñcālas%},
would himself destroy the chariot-force. {%Sahadeva%} (with 700
elephants, 5,000 horses, and 3,000 foot-soldiers) + the
{%Draupadeyas & Śakuni%}, who, with 6,000 horses, went away;
similarly, the {%Pāṇḍava%} force, which was reduced to 6,000
horses; the {%Draupadeyas%} proceeded to {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Sahadeva%}
to {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Śakuni & Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} division; after
a terrible battle the {%Pāṇḍavas%} encompassed {%Śakuni%} (IX, {@23@}).
{%Śakuni%} exhorted the remainder of his following, 700 horses,
and urged {%Duryodhana%} to attack the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek">μμ</lang>); the
remnant of the {%Kuru%} army attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas; Arjuna%}
(desiring to exterminate the {%Kurus%}) addressed {%Kṛṣṇa%},
recounting the loss sustained by the {%Kurus%} (<lang n="greek">νν</lang>), and
attacked the remnant of the {%Kuru%} army, and caused a great
slaughter (IX, {@24@}). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξξ</lang>), & the
chariot-force; {%Duryodhana%} escaped on horseback to {%Śakuni%};
3,000 elephants encompassed the {%Pāṇḍava%} brothers, and
were slain by {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">οο</lang>). {%Aśvatthāman%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ππ</lang>), enquired about {%Duryodhana%}, pierced through
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} force, and proceeded to {%Śakuni%}. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, assailed the {%Kurus%}.
{%Sañjaya%} (having joined the five leaders and posted his men,
who had been afflicted by {%Arjuna%}, by {%Kṛpa%}) {%& Dhṛṣṭadyumna%};
{%Sātyaki & Sañjaya%}, who was made captive; {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}
destroyed the elephants; {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc., seeking {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}, proceeded to {%Śakuni%} (IX, {@25@}). Eleven sons of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Durmarṣaṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρρ</lang>), {%& Bhīmasena%}, who
slew them. {%Bhīmasena%} then slew 500 chariot-warriors, 10,000
foot, 700 elephants, and 800 horses (IX, {@26@}). {%Duryodhana%}
and {%Sudarśa%} (the only sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} yet unslain) were
in the midst of the cavalry. {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} to destroy
the remnant of {%Duryodhana's%} troops (<lang n="greek">σσ</lang>); {%Arjuna%} assented (<lang n="greek">ττ</lang>);
“only 500 horses form the remnant of the troops of {%Śakuni%}
{%…%}; there remain also {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">υυ</lang>).”
{%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕϕ</lang>), & {%Duryodhana + Śakuni; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
son {%Sudarśana & Bhīmasena; Suśarman%} and {%Śakuni & Arjuna%};

etc., and then proceeded against the remnant of the {%Bharata%}
host. {%Bhīma%} slew {%Sudarśana%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra), and completed

{%Sahadeva; Ulūka & Bhīmasena; Sahadeva%} sat down on his
chariot; {%Bhīma%} and {%Sahadeva & Śakuni's%} men, who fled away,
but were rallied by {%Duryodhana; Sahadeva + Nakula%} and

who slew him (IX, {@28@}).
