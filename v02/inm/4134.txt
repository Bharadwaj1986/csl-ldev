COMBAT AFTER THE FOURTEENTH DAY: A dreadful battle took
place between the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Kauravas. Duryodhana%}.

to the rescue of {%Duryodhana%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas & Droṇa%} (VII,
{@153@}). {%Arjuna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) & {%Droṇa%}. (Description of the awful
night) (VII, {@154@}.) {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} about the
battle (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Sañjaya%} related: {%Droṇa%} slew the {%Kaikeyas%} and
the sons of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc., and {%Śibi; Duryodhana%} sent
{%Droṇa%} a driver for his chariot; the {%Kaliṅga%} prince attacked
{%Bhīma%} (and {%Viśoka%}) and was slain by {%Bhīma%} with his bare
fists); {%Karṇa%} and {%Dhruva%} (the brother of the {%Kaliṅga%} prince)

with a slap of his palm; {%Śakuni%} rescued {%Karṇa; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
sons & {%Bhīma; Durmada%} mounted the chariot of {%Duṣkarṇa%};
then, before the eyes of {%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), {%Bhīma%}, by a kick
of his foot, caused that chariot to sink into the earth, and with
his fists crushed {%Durmada%} and {%Duṣkarṇa%}. All the kings fled
away; {%Bhīma%} repaired to {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>)

slain {%Bhūriśravas%} while sitting in {%prāya%} (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); {%Sātyaki's%} reply
(<lang n="greek">η</lang>). {%Somadatta + Duryodhana%} and {%Śakuni & Sātyaki +%}

{%Droṇa & Sātyaki + Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>); the {%Pāṇḍava%} host
fled away; {%Arjuna + Bhīma (+ Viśoka%}) + the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc.

chariot) + Rā. & {%Aśvatthāman%}; description of the battle of
Rā.; the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc., and {%Karṇa%} fled away,
but not {%Aśvatthāman%}, who soon dispelled the illusive creations
[Page305-a+ 63]
of {%Ghaṭotkaca; Aśvatthāman & Ghaṭotkaca%} + the latter's son
{%Añjanaparvan%}, who was slain by {%Aśvatthāman; Ghaṭotkaca%}
created illusions; {%Aśvatthāman%} invoked the {%Vajra%} weapon
and then the {%Vāyavya%} weapon; the followers of {%Ghaṭotkaca%}
were {%Paulastyas%} and {%Yātudhānas. Duryodhana%} was afraid of
them, but quieted by {%Aśvatthāman%} he urged {%Śakuni%} to proceed
against {%Arjuna%} with {%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), and a great force; and he
should also slay {%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>). {%Śakuni%} proceeded quickly.
{%Ghaṭotkaca & Aśvatthāman%}, who burnt a full {%akṣauhiṇī%}
of Rā. troops and destroyed the chariot of {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, who
mounted {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} chariot. {%Bhīmasena + Ghaṭotkaca%}
{%+ Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), & {%Aśvatthāman%}, who destroyed
the Rā. host and caused a river of blood, and slew {%Drupada's%}
son {%Suratha%}, and then {%Suratha's%} younger brother {%Śatruñjaya%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>); {%Ghaṭotkaca%} was made insensible by {%Aśvatthāman%}
and borne away by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Yudhiṣṭhira's%} chariots
turned away. Si., G., Pś., N., birds, P., etc., Aps., and the
gods applauded {%Aśvatthāman%} (VII, {@156@}). Beholding the
sons of {%Drupada%} and {%Kuntibhoja%} and Rā. in thousands slain
by {%Aśvatthāman, Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), set their hearts firmly
on battle. {%Somadatta & Yuyudhāna + Bhīma%}, who made
{%Somadatta%} insensible, and slew {%Pratīpa's%} son {%Bāhlīka%} (the
father of Somadatta), ten sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Nāgadatta%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), & {%Bhīma%}, who slew them. {%Vṛkaratha%} (the brother of
{%Karṇa%}) & {%Bhīma%}, who slew him, and thereupon seven brothers
of {%Śakuni%}, and pressed {%Śatacandra%} down into the earth.
{%Śakuni's%} five brothers, {%Gavākṣa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>) & {%Bhīma%}, who
slew them. {%Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira%} began to
slay the {%Ambaṣṭhas%} (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>); {%Droṇa%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} employed
the {%Vāyavya%} weapon; then {%Droṇa%} employed the {%Vāruṇa%},
{%Yāmya, Āgneya, Tvāṣṭra%}, and {%Sāvitra%}, which were all baffled
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; then {%Droṇa%} invoked the {%Aindra%} and the
{%Prājāpatya%} weapons, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the {%Māhendra%}; then
both employed the {%Brāhma%} weapon. {%Droṇa%} (with the {%Vāyavya%}
weapon, abandoning {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}) & {%Drupada's%} division, who
fled, but were rallied by {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīma%}, who attacked {%Droṇa%}
from two sides, and were followed by the {%Kaikayas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>).
The {%Kurus%} fled; {%Droṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%} in vain tried to rally
them (VII, {@157@}). {%Duryodhana%} urged {%Karṇa%} to defeat the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} ({%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>)); {%Karṇa%} vowed to slay {%Arjuna%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">υ</lang>), and was ridiculed by {%Kṛpa%} (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>), who said that
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>), were all fighting for the {%Pāṇḍavas%};
{%Karṇa%} vowed to cut off {%Kṛpa's%} tongue if {%Kṛpa%} addressed him
again in the same strain, naming {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψ</lang>), as
invincible, and saying that {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ω</lang>), had been slain
by the work of destiny (VII, {@158@}). {%Aśvatthāman%} in rage
rebuked {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek">αα</lang>); {%Duryodhana%} and {%Kṛpa%} pacified {%Karṇa%}
and {%Aśvatthāman. Karṇa%} & the {%Pāṇḍavas + Pāñcālas%}, who
were vanquished and slaughtered. Urged by {%Duryodhana%},
{%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ββ</lang>), & {%Arjuna%} in order to rescue {%Karṇa%};
{%Arjuna%} slew the steeds and driver of {%Karṇa%} and made him loose
his bow; {%Karṇa%} took shelter in {%Kṛpa's%} chariot. {%Duryodhana%}
(rallying the troops) & {%Arjuna; Kṛpa%} urged {%Aśvatthāman%}
to proceed against {%Arjuna. Aśvatthāman%} made {%Duryodhana%}
desist from an encounter with {%Arjuna; Duryodhana%} urged
{%Aśvatthāman%} to slay the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Somakas%} (VII, {@159@}).
{%Aśvatthāman%} said that he, etc. (<lang n="greek">γγ</lang>). could destroy the foe
within the twinkling of an eye, and promised to fight with
the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δδ</lang>). {%Aśvatthāman%} routed the {%Pāñcālas%},
etc. {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Aśvatthāman%}; Si. and Cā., etc.,
applauded them; {%Aśvatthāman%} cut off the bow, the standard,
the drivers, and the steeds of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}; the {%Pāñcālas%}
and {%Sṛñjayas%} fled away (VII, {@160@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and
[Page305-b+ 63]
{%Bhīma & Aśvatthāman + Duryodhana; Yudhiṣṭhira%} slew the
{%Ambaṣṭhas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δδ</lang>), {%Bhīma%} the {%Abhīṣāhas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">εε</lang>), {%Arjuna%}
the {%Yaudheyas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζζ</lang>). {%Droṇa%} employed the {%Vāyavya%}
weapon; the {%Pāñcālas%} fled, but were rallied by {%Bhīma%} and
{%Arjuna%}, who attacked {%Droṇa%} from both sides together with
the {%Sṛñjayas%}, etc.; the {%Kauravas%} fled; {%Duryodhana%} and {%Droṇa%}
endeavoured in vain to rally them (VII, {@161@}). {%Sātyaki%}
(with white steeds of the {%Sindhu%} breed) {%+ Bhīmasena &%}
{%Somadatta%} ({%Bāhlīka's%} son), who was slain by {%Sātyaki%}.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira + Pāṇḍavas + Prabhadrakas & Droṇa; Droṇa%}
and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} employed the {%Vāyavya%} weapon. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
dissuaded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} from fighting with {%Droṇa%}; he should
go to {%Duryodhana, Arjuna%}, and {%Bhīma%} (VII, {@162@}). {%Droṇa%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ηη</lang>), afflicted one another and the troops; both armies
were dejected. The remnants of the slaughtered army were
once more disposed in array; {%Droṇa%} in the van, {%Śalya%} in the
rear, {%Aśvatthāman%} and {%Śakuni%} on the right and left flanks;
{%Duryodhana%} protected all the troops. {%Duryodhana%} ordered
his troops to take up lighted lamps and torches. D., Ṛ., G.,
D.-ṛ., V.-D., Aps., N., Y., U., and K. also took up lamps, and
many lamps came from {%Nārada%} and {%Parvata%} for {%Duryodhana's%}
sake. (Description); the glare reached the skies, and
awakened by it, D., G., Y., Ṛ., etc., and Aps. came there
(VII, {@163@}). {%Duryodhana%} appointed his brothers {%Vikarṇa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">θθ</lang>), to protect {%Droṇa%} from the rear; {%Kṛtavarman%} should
protect his right wheel, and {%Śala%} his left. The remnants of
the {%Trigartas%} he placed in the van; especially {%Droṇa%} should
be protected against {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}; “{%Karṇa%} will vanquish
{%Arjuna, Bhīmasena%}, and others.” {%Arjuna%} & the {%Kauravas%};
{%Aśvatthāman%} & the {%Pāñcāla%} ruler; {%Droṇa%} & the {%Sṛñjayas%}
(VII, {@164@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} commanded all his warriors to
proceed against {%Droṇa%} alone. The {%Pāñcālas%} & the {%Somakas &%}
{%Droṇa; Kṛtavarman & Yudhiṣṭhira%} (advancing against
{%Droṇa%}); {%Yuyudhāna & Bhūri; Karṇa & Sahadeva%} (advancing
in order to get at {%Droṇa%}); {%Duryodhana & Bhīmasena; Śakuni &%}

against {%Droṇa%}); {%Śalya & Virāṭa%} (advancing in order to
slay {%Droṇa%}); {%Citrasena & Nakula's%} son {%Śatānīka%} (advancing
in order to slay {%Droṇa%}); {%Alambuṣa & Arjuna; Dhṛṣṭad-%}
{%yumna & Droṇa%}, etc.; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} retreated, and {%Kṛtavarman%}
once more began to protect the wheel of {%Droṇa's%} chariot
(VII, {@165@}). {%Bhūri & Sātyaki%} who slew him. {%Aśvatthāman &%}
{%Sātyaki; Ghaṭotkaca & Aśvatthāman%}, who swooned away,
but then made {%Ghaṭotkaca%} insensible, who was borne away
by his charioteer. {%Bhīma%} crushed the steeds, the charioteer,
and the chariot of {%Duryodhana%}, who ascended {%Nandaka's%}
chariot, and was regarded as slain, also by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
who rushed to {%Bhīma%}. The {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ιι</lang>), & {%Droṇa%} (VII,
{@166@}). {%Karṇa & Sahadeva%}, who was worsted by {%Karṇa%}, who
touched him with his bow and scoffed at him (<lang n="greek">κκ</lang>), but did
not slay him, recollecting the words of {%Kuntī; Sahadeva%}
ascended the chariot of the {%Pāñcāla%} prince {%Janamejaya%}.
{%Virāṭa & Śalya%}, who deprived him of his chariot and then
slew {%Virāṭa's%} brother {%Śatānīka%}; once more {%Virāṭa%} (ascending
{%Śatānīka's%} chariot) & {%Śalya%}, who made him insensible;
{%Virāṭa%} was carried away by his charioteer; the host fled away.
{%Alambuṣa%} (with terrible-looking {%Piśācas%} of equine faces
yoked to his chariot; description) & {%Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa%}), who
vanquished him; {%Alambuṣa%} fled away. {%Arjuna%} quickly
proceeded towards {%Droṇa%}, slaughtering men, etc.; they all
fled (VII, {@167@}). {%Citrasena%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & {%Nakula's%}
son {%Śatānīka%}, who vanquished him; {%Citrasena%} ascended
[Page306-a+ 63]
{%Kṛtavarman's%} chariot; {%Vṛṣasena & Drupada%}, who swooned
and was carried off by his charioteer; {%Vṛṣasena%} caused a great
slaughter among the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Somakas%}, and then
proceeded to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duḥśāsana%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra) &
{%Prativindhya%}, who was vanquished by him and rescued by his
brothers, ascended the chariot of {%Sutasoma%} and continued to
fight {%Duḥśāsana%}, to whose assistance many warriors rushed,
and a fierce battle ensued (VII, {@168@}). {%Nakula & Śakuni%}, who
was carried away by his charioteer; {%Nakula%} proceeded towards
{%Droṇa. Śikhaṇḍin%} (proceeding towards {%Droṇa%}) & {%Kṛpa%};
({%Śikhaṇḍin%} was carried away by his charioteer); the {%Pāñcālas%}
and {%Somakas%} surrounded him, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons sur-
rounded {%Droṇa%}. A battle commenced once more (description)
(VII, {@169@}). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (+ the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%})
& {%Droṇa%}; D., G., and Dā. wished prosperity to {%Droṇa%};
{%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λλ</lang>) (in order to rescue {%Droṇa%}) & {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%};
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Drumasena%}, whom he slew; the six chariot
warriors & {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Sātyaki%} (in order to rescue
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}) & {%Karṇa%}; the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra + Karṇa +%}
{%Karṇa's%} son {%Vṛṣasena & Dhṛṣṭadyumna + Sātyaki; Gāṇḍīva%}
was heard, and the sound of {%Arjuna's%} chariot. {%Karṇa%}
counselled {%Duryodhana%} to encompass and slay {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
and {%Sātyaki; Duryoḍhana%} dispatched {%Śakuni%} with a large force
(also {%Duḥśāsana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μμ</lang>)) against {%Arjuna%}, to slay {%Arjuna%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">νν</lang>); a great fight commenced. {%Śakāuni%}, etc., & {%Sātyaki%};
{%Droṇa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} + the {%Pāñcālas%} (VII, {@170@}). {%Sātyaki%}
was surrounded by many leaders of the {%Kuru%} army; {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana & Yuyudhāna%}, who forced him to fly away (having
mounted the chariot of {%Kṛtavarman%}), and routed the foes with
whom he was engaged. {%Arjuna & Śakuni%} (+ his son {%Ulūka%}),
whom he deprived of his chariot; {%Śakuni%} ascended the
chariot of {%Ulūka; Arjuna%} slew the {%Kuru%} army. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
{%Arjuna%} blew their conches. {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa%}, whom
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} checked and caused an immense carnage.
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξξ</lang>), blew their conches (VII, {@171@}).
{%Duryodhana%} in anger addressed {%Droṇa%} and {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek">οο</lang>), who
furiously attacked and routed the {%Pāṇḍava%} army; {%Droṇa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ππ</lang>); the {%Pāṇḍava%} host fled, throwing down their torches
before the eyes of {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρρ</lang>), pursued by {%Droṇa%} and
{%Karṇa; Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} rallied the retreating troops (<lang n="greek">σσ</lang>);
a wild battle ensued between the {%Kurus%} (especially {%Droṇa%}
and {%Karṇa%}) and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (especially {%Yudhiṣṭhira%})
(description) (VII, {@172@}). {%Karṇa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, who
was deprived of his chariot by him, but then slew his steeds
and ascended the chariot of {%Arjuna%} and desired to proceed,
but was stopped by {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Karṇa%} routed the {%Pāñcālas%},
who, with the {%Somakas%}, attacked {%Karṇa%}. Meanwhile {%Karṇa's%}
charioteer had yoked other white steeds of the {%Sindhu%}
breed to his chariot. The {%Pāñcāla%} host (and the {%Sṛñjayas%})
fled (description); others, only observed by {%Droṇa%}, fled away
on all sides. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna%} (and {%Kṛṣṇa%}) conversed
about {%Karṇa; Arjuna%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to proceed towards
{%Karṇa. Kṛṣṇa%} said that none except {%Arjuna%} and {%Ghaṭotkaca%}
could encounter him; but {%Arjuna%} must not do it, as long as
he had the lance given him by {%Indra%}; “but {%Ghaṭotkaca%} (who
had celestial weapons, as also those used by Rā. and As.),
would vanquish {%Karṇa%}.” They prevailed upon {%Ghaṭotkaca%} to
encounter {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek">ττ</lang>); “thou, O {%Ghaṭotkaca, Sātyaki%}, and
{%Bhīmasena%} are the foremost among all our warriors; {%Sātyaki%}
will protect thy rear.” {%Ghaṭotkaca & Karṇa%} (VII, {@173@}).
{%Duryodhana%} urged {%Duḥśāsana%} to protect {%Karṇa%} against
{%Ghaṭotkaca%}. Meanwhile the Rā. {%Jaṭāsura's%} son {%Alambuṣa%}
said to {%Duryodhana%} that he wished to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in
[Page306-b+ 63]
order to avenge his father, whom they had slain, performing
some Rā.-slaying incantations. {%Duryodhana%} urged him to slay
{%Ghaṭotkaca. Alambuṣa & Ghaṭotkaca%}; both resorted to their
power of illusion (<lang n="greek">υυ</lang>); {%Ghaṭotkaca%} slew {%Alambuṣa%} and threw
his head upon {%Duryodhana's%} chariot, promising that he should
also see the slaughter of {%Karṇa%} and then his own. {%Ghaṭotkaca%}
{%& Karṇa%} (VII, {@174@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%}
described {%Ghaṭotkaca's%} person, armour, weapons, and chariot;
then the encounter between {%Karṇa & Ghaṭotkaca%}, who
employed Rā.-illusion, and even destroyed the celestial
weapon of {%Karṇa%}; a {%Vāyavya%} weapon was employed by
{%Karṇa%} to destroy clouds; {%Ghaṭotkaca%} was once seen on a
chariot, created by illusion, yoked with a number of asses,
looking like elephants, and having the faces of {%Piśācas%};
{%Ghaṭotkaca%} employed an {%aśani%} of {%Rudra's%} workmanship,
furnished with eight wheels; there appeared many Rā., Pś.,
and {%Yātudhānas%}, etc. (VII, {@175@}). Meanwhile, the Rā.
{%Alāyudha%}, with many thousands of Rā., came to {%Duryodhana%},
and said that he wished to avenge his kinsmen {%Baka%} and
{%Kirmīra%}, and his friend {%Hiḍimba%}, and the marriage of
{%Hiḍimbā%}, by slaying all the sons of {%Kuntī%}, especially {%Bhīma%},
with {%Kṛṣṇa, Ghaṭotkaca%}, etc. {%Duryodhana%} urged him to slay
{%Bhīma. Alāyudha's%} chariot, steeds, weapons, etc., were pretty
much as those of {%Ghaṭotkaca's%} (description) (VII, {@176@}).
The {%Kurus%} with {%Duryodhana%} welcomed {%Alāyudha%}, having
been (with {%Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕϕ</lang>)), very anxious about {%Karṇa%},
who was engaged with {%Ghaṭotkaca. Alāyudha & Ghaṭotkaca%}
(abandoning {%Karṇa%}); {%Karṇa & Bhīmasena; Bhīma%} (disregarding
the advancing {%Karṇa%}) {%& Alāyudha%} (abandoning {%Ghaṭotkaca%}) +
all the other Rā. (who fled away); the Rā. attacked the
elephants, the {%Pāñcālas%}, and the {%Sṛñjayas. Kṛṣṇa%} urged
{%Arjuna%} to proceed in {%Bhīma's%} wake, and to let {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">χχ</lang>), proceed against {%Karṇa, Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψψ</lang>), slay the
other Rā.; {%Arjuna%} himself should resist {%Droṇa's%} division;
then {%Kṛṣṇa%} dispatched {%Ghaṭotkaca%} to protect {%Bhīmasena%}
(VII, {@177@}). {%Ghaṭotkaca%} (abandoning {%Karṇa%}) & {%Alāyudha%}
(brother of {%Baka%}). Meanwhile, {%Yuyudhāna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ωω</lang>), & the
Rā. of {%Alāyudha; Arjuna%} shot many {%kṣatriyas, Karṇa%} many
{%Pāñcālas%} headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc. {%Bhīma%}
{%+ Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ααα</lang>) (having slain the Rā.) & {%Karṇa%}; the
{%Pāñcālas & Droṇa; Alāyudha%} resorted to his power of illusion,
and so did {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, who cut off the head of {%Alāyudha%} and
threw it down before {%Duryodhana%}, who, with all his troops,
became full of anxiety, while the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} roared
like lions (VII, {@178@}). {%Karṇa%} & the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">βββ</lang>);
many of them entered the force of {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Ghaṭotkaca &%}
{%Karṇa%}, who had his steeds and charioteer slain by {%Ghaṭotkaca%},
who then disappeared from view, and created a terrible
illusion (description), which severely afflicted the {%Kuru%} host,
which at last fled; {%Karṇa%} alone kept his ground, looked at by
all the {%Saindhavas%} and {%Bāhlikas; Karṇa's%} steeds were again
slain by {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, and his celesṭial weapon was baffled by
{%Ghaṭotkava's%} illusion. The {%Kauravas%} urged him to slay
{%Ghaṭotkaca%} with the dart presented to him by {%Indra%}, without
minding {%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γγγ</lang>). When {%Karṇa%} held the dart in
his hands {%Ghaṭotkaca%} began to fly away in fear, all creatures
in the skies uttered loud cries, etc.; {%Karṇa%} hurled the dart,
and {%Ghaṭotkaca%} was slain, and falling upon the {%Kaurava%}
army with his gigantic body, he slew a full {%akṣauhiṇī%},
desirous of benefiting the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. The {%Kauravas%} uttered
loud shouts of joy; {%Karṇa%} ascended the chariot of {%Duryodhana%}
and entered the {%Kuru%} host (VII, {@179@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were
filled with grief; only {%Kṛṣṇa%} with transports of delight
[Page307-a+ 63]
raised his warcry, embracing {%Arjuna%}, to whom he explained
that he rejoiced because {%Karṇa's%} dart could not now
kill {%Arjuna%}, having been employed against {%Ghaṭotkaca%}; he
recited to {%Arjuna%} how he had gradually caused all the foes of
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to be slain (VII, {@180@}), which he explained
more explicitly (<lang n="greek">δδδ</lang>) (VII, {@181@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
why {%Karṇa%} had not hurled the fatal dart at {%Arjuna, Sañjaya%}
assigned {%Kṛṣṇa's%} policy as the reason (<lang n="greek">εεε</lang>), though it had
formed the subject of deliberation with {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζζζ</lang>),
every night. {%Sātyaki%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} why {%Karṇa%} had not
hurled his dart at {%Arjuna; Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Duḥśāsana%},
etc., had frequently discussed this subject, and {%Karṇa%} had
approved of it; but {%Kṛṣṇa%} always used to stupefy him;
{%Kṛṣṇa%} had neither sleep nor joy in his heart, as long as he
could not frustrate that instrument for killing {%Arjuna%} (VII,
{@182@}). Concluding from {%Karṇa's%} not using the dart (<lang n="greek">εεε</lang>, <lang n="greek">ζζζ</lang>),
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} attributed the ill success of the {%Kurus%} to
Destiny, their own folly, and the policy of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and asked
{%Sañjaya%} about the battle (<lang n="greek">ηηη</lang>). {%Sañjaya%} related: All the
{%Kauravas%} uttered loud shouts and began to slay the {%Pāṇḍava%}
troops. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told {%Bhīmasena%} to resist the {%Dhārta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%} host, himself sitting down with tearful face; {%Kṛṣṇa%}
comforted him, but {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} remembered the many services
{%Ghaṭotkaca%} had rendered them (<lang n="greek">θθθ</lang>); {%Droṇa%} and {%Aśvatthāman%}
were the real cause of {%Abhimanyu's%} slaughter, but it was
{%Jayadratha%} who was slain; “{%Droṇa%} and {%Karṇa%} are the root
of our woes”; therefore {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} will slay {%Karṇa%},
{%Bhīmasena%} being engaged with {%Droṇa's%} division. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
quickly proceeded against {%Karṇa%}, followed by the {%Pāñcālas%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ιιι</lang>). {%Vyāsa%} approached {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and congratulated
him upon {%Karṇa's%} having employed his dart against {%Ghaṭotkaca%};
“on the 5th day from hence the earth will be thine.” Then
he disappeared (VII, {@183@}).
