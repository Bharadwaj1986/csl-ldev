{#पृषोदर#}¦ mfn. ({#-रः-रा-रं#}) Having a spot or circle on the belly. According
<>to Professor Turkabāchaspati:--{#पृषः दिवोदरं यस्य पृषो० तलोपः#} 1. Small-
<>bellied, and {#पृषन्ति उदरे यस्य#}. 2. Air, wind. But in his other works
<>this word is taken as a type of such irregular compounds. Accor-
<>ding to others:--E. {#पृषत्#} a drop of any thing liquid, and {#उदर#} the
<>belly, form irregular and special; the word is most commonly in
<>use as a grammatical term, being the leading word of a class in
<>which the formation of each is peculiar to itself, and being thence
<>applied to designate the rule which comprehends the whole of
<>the series.
