{#अश्वमेध#}¦ m. ({#-धः#}) The actual or emblematic sacrifice of a horse. E. {#अश्व#} and
{#मेध#} sacrifice; this sacrifice is one of the highest order, and performed
a hundred times, entitles the sacrificer to the dominion of Swarga
or paradise: it appears to have been originally typical; the horse,
and other animals being simply bound during the performance
of certain ceremonies; the actual sacrifice is an introduction of a
later period. See As. R. Vol. viii. p. 442, COLEBROOKE on the Vedas.
