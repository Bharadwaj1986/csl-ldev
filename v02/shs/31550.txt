{#मीमांसा#}¦ f. ({#-सा#}) One of the philosophical systems of the Hindus, or
rather a two-fold system, the two parts of which form two of the
six Darśhanas or schools of philosophy; the first part, the Pūrva
Mīmānsā, or Mīmānś simply, originates with the Muni JAIMINĪ,
and illustrates the Karma-kāṇḍa of the Vedas or the practical
part, (the ritual,) of religion and devotion, including also moral
and legal obligations. The second part, or Uttara Mīmāṃsā,
ascribed to VYĀSA, is the same as the Vedānta, founded on
the Jnāna-kāṇḍa, or theological portion of the Vedas, and
treating of the spiritual worship of the Supreme Being or soul
of the universe. E. {#मान्#} to seek knowledge, affs. {#अङ्#} and {#टाप्;#} the
derivative takes the augment of the reduplicate form of the verb.
