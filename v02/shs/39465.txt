{#शप्#}¦ r. 1st cl. ({#शपति-ते#}) r. 4th cl. ({#शप्यति-ते#}) 1. To revile, to wish evi-
imprecations on, to curse. 2. To take an oath, to swear; in this
sense {#शप्#} sometimes governs a cognate accusative; but gener-
ally it takes the accusative of the person to whom a promise is
made, and the instrumental of the object by which it is made;
when used intransitively it governs the dative of the object or
person, by which the oath is taken. 3. To blame.
