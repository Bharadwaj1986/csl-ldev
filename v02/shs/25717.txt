{#पूर्व्वमीमांसा#}¦ f. ({#-सा#}) An inquiry into the ritual portion of the Veda. It is
<>called {#पूर्व्वमीमांसा#} in contradistinction to the Vedānta system which
<>is considered to be a sequel to Jaimini's system and is styled {#उत्तर#}
<>{#मीमांसा;#} there is however very little in common between the two
<>systems.
