{#ययाति#}¦ m. ({#-तिः#}) A monarch of India the fifth of the lunar race and son
<>of NAHUSA. At first he married Devajāni, the only child of SŪKRA,
<>the preceptor of the demons and subsequently ŚARMISHṬHĀ the
<>daughter of VRISHAPARVAN, who was ordered by her father to attend
<>on Devajāni as a servant, as a punishment for her throwing her in
<>a well. For his marrying and making love to ŚARMISHṬHĀ Yajāti
<>became old and infirm before his time through the curse of SUKRA,
<>but having appeased his father-in-law obtained permission to
<>transfer his decrepitude to any one who would consent to take it.
<>Out of his five sons PURU complied with his father's wishes. The
<>King being endowed with renovated youth, passed his time in
<>the enjoyment of pleasures for a full thousand years, and after
<>which he restored his youth to PURU and resuming his own de-
<>crepitude departed to the wood of penance. E. {#यस्य वायोरिव याति-#}
