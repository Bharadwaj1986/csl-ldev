<>cribed; the {#स्वर्णमाक्षिक#} or gold Mākshika, of a bright yellow colour,
<>apparently the common pyritic iron ore: and the {#रूप्यमाक्षिक#} or

<>rites of iron; other names of these ores occur; as {#विट्माक्षिक#} and
<>{#कांस्यमाक्षिक,#} or feculent Mākshika and mixed metal Mākshika
<>they are however, perhaps rather synonymes of the gold and
<>silver ore, respectively, than names of distinct species. 2. Honey.
<>E. {#मक्षिका#} a bee, {#अण्#} aff. of derivation; the name is applied to the
<>ore, from its honey-like colour.
