{#राजर्षि#}¦ m. ({#-र्षिः#}) A kind of saint; that holy and superhuman personage
which a king or man of the military class may become by the
practice of religious austerities; seven classes of Rishis are enu-
merated, the DeVARSHI, BRAHMARSHI, MAHARSHI, PARAMARSHI,
RAJARSHI, KĀṆḌARSHI, and ŚRUTARSHI: the order is variously
given, but the RĀJARSHI is inferior to the four preceding ones,
and the two last mean the inspired saints and supposed authors of
the scriptures. E. {#राज#} king, and {#ऋषि#} a saint.
