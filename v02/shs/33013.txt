three classes; one sort of Rākshas is of a domi-celestial nature
and is ranked with the attendants on KUVERA; another corres-
ponds to a goblin, an imp, or ogre, haunting cemeteries, animat-
ing dead bodies, disturbing sacrifices, and ensnaring and devour-
ing human beings; the third kind approaches more to the nature
of the Titan, or relentless, and powerful enemy of the gods. E. {#रक्ष्#}
to preserve, (KUVERA'S treasure, &c.) {#असुन्#} aff.; also {#राक्षस ।#}
