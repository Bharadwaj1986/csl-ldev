{#मण्डलेश्वर#}¦ m. ({#-रः#}) A sovereign, a monarch. E. {#मण्डल#} a district, and {#ईश्चर#}
a sovereign; the power of this prince is limited by AMARA, and
the Mandaleswara is considered as an emperor or supreme prince,
only when in addition to his territorial sway, he has performed
the Rājasuya sacrifice, in which he has been attended by all his
tributary or subject princes: other authorities confound the so-
vereign of a Mandala, with the Chakravarti or emperor, and with
the Samrāj or lord paramount, and others confine him to the
government of a district of twenty or forty Yojanas in each
direction.
