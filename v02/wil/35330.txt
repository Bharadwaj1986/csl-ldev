{#विन्ध्यकूट#}¦ m. ({#-टः#}) The saint AGASTYA.
.E. {#विन्ध्य#} the mountain, and {#कूट#} to give pain, aff. {#क#}, or with
{#युच्#} aff. {#विन्ध्यकूटन#}; {%Vindhya%} the personified mountain, having
once prostrated himself before AGASTYA his spiritual guide, was ordered by the
saint to remain in that posture, as a punishment for the presumption, which had
induced him to attempt rivalling the heighth of {%Meru%} and {%Himālaya.%} The
legend appears to originate in the little elevation of the {%Vindhya%} chain
compared with its extent.
