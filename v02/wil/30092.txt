{#माक्षिक#}¦ n. ({#-कं#})
.²1 A mineral substance, of which two kinds are described; the {#स्वर्णमाक्षिक#}
or gold {%Mākṣika,%} of a bright yellow colour, apparently the common pyritic
iron ore: and the {#रूप्यमाक्षिक#} or silver {%Mākṣika,%} which answers in
appearance to the {%Hepatic%} pyrites of iron; other names of these ores occur;
as, {#विट्माक्षिक#} and {#कांस्यमाक्षिक#}, or feculent {%Mākṣika%} and mixed
metal {%Mākṣika;%} they are however, perhaps rather synonyms of the gold and
silver ore, respectively, than names of distinct species.
.²2 Honey.
.E. {#माक्षिका#} a bee, {#अण्#} aff. of derivation; the name is applied to the
ore, from its honey-like colour.
