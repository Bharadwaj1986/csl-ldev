.E. {#प्र#} before {#मा#} to measure, aff. {#ल्युट्#}; that by which all is
measured; this word is generally restricted to the singular number, as
{#वेदाः-प्रमाणं#} the {%Vedas%} are the authority; it is also confined to the
neuter gender, as {#पुत्त्रः प्रमाणं#} the boy is a witness; some exceptions
occur however, as {#प्रमाणः पुरुषः, प्रमाणा स्त्री#} the man witness, the woman
witness; and in the following rule, {#प्रत्यक्षानुभानोपमानशब्दाः-प्रमाणानि#}
perception, inference, comparison, and sound, are proofs.
