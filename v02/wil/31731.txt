{#रक्षस्#}¦ n. ({#-क्षः#}) A {%Rakṣas,%} an evil spirit, apparently
distinguishable into three classes: one sort of {%Rakṣas%} is of a
demi-celestial nature, and is ranked with the attendants on KUVERA; another
corresponds to a goblin, an imp, or ogre, haunting cemeteries, animating dead
bodies, disturbing sacrifices, and ensnaring and devouring human beings; the
third kind approaches more to the nature of the {%Titan,%} or relentless and
powerful enemy of the gods.
.E. {#रक्ष#} to preserve, (KUVERA'S treasures, &c.) {#असुन्#} aff.; also
{#राक्षम#}.
