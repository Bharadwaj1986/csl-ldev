{#पुराण#}¦ n. ({#-णं#}) A {%Purāṇa%} or sacred and poetical work, supposed
to be compiled or composed by the poet VYĀSA; and comprising the whole body of
{%Hindu%} theology: each {%Purāṇa%} should treat of five topics especially;
the creation, the destruction, and renovation of worlds; the genealogy of gods
and heroes; the reigns of the {%Menus,%} and the transactions of their
descendants: but great variety prevails in this respect, and few contain
historical or genealogical matter. There are eighteen acknowledged
{%Purāṇas.%}
.²1 BRĀHMA.
.²2 {%Pādma,%} or the lotus.
.²3 {%Brahmāṇḍa,%} or the egg of BRAHMA.
.²4 {%Āgneya,%} or {%Agni%} fire.
.²5 VAIṢṆAVA, or of VIṢṆU.
.²6 {%Garuḍa.%}
.²7 {%Brahmavaivarta,%} or transformations of BRAHMA, that is of KṚṢṆA,
identified with the Supreme.
.²8 ŚAIVA, or of ŚIVA.
.²9 {%Liṅga.%}
.²10 NĀRADĪYA.
.²11 SKANDA.
.²12 MĀRKAṆḌEYA, so called from a {%Muni%} of that name.

.²17 {%Vāmana,%} or dwarf, and
.²18 The {%Bhāgavata,%} or life of KṚṢṆA, which last is by some considered
as a spurious and modern work: the {%Brahmavaivarta%} is also of very modern
origin. The {%Purāṇas%} are reckoned to contain four hundred thousand stanzas:
there are also eighteen {%Upapurāṇas%} or similar poems of inferior sanctity,
and different appellations; the whole constitute the popular or poetical creed
of the {%Hindus,%} and some of them or particular parts of them, are very
generally read, and studied. m. ({#-णः#}) A {%karṣa%} or measure of silver
equal to sixteen {%Paṇas%} of {%Cowries.%} mfn. ({#-णः-णा#} or {#णी-णं#}) Old,
ancient.
.E. {#पुरा#} old, and {#द्यु#} aff. or {#पुरा#} the same, {#णी#} to get or be,
and {#ड#} aff.
