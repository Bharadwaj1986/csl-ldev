<hom>2.</hom> <s>इ꣡ति</s> ¦ <lex>ind.</lex> (<ab>fr.</ab> pronominal base 3. <s>इ</s>), in this manner, thus (in its original signification <s>इ꣡ति</s> refers to something that has been said or thought, or lays stress on what precedes;
in the <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1>s it is often equivalent to ‘as you know’, reminding the hearer or reader of certain customs, conditions, &c. supposed to be known to him). In quotations of every kind <s>इ꣡ति</s> means that the preceding words are the very words which some person has or might have spoken, and placed thus at the end of a speech it serves the purpose of inverted commas (<s>इ꣡त्य् उक्त्वा</s>, having so said;
<s>इ꣡ति कृत्वा</s>, having so considered, having so decided). It may often have reference merely to what is passing in the mind <ab>e.g.</ab> <s>बालो ऽपि ना<स्र्स्꣡>वमन्तव्यो मनुष्य इ꣡ति भूमिपः</s>, a king, though a child, is not to be despised, saying to one's self, ‘he is a mortal’, (<ls>Gr. 928.</ls>) In <ab>dram.</ab> <s>इ꣡ति तथा करोति</s> means ‘after these words he acts thus.’ 
<div n="p"/>Sometimes <s>इ꣡ति</s> is used to include under one head a number of separate objects aggregated together (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>इज्या<स्र्स्꣡>ध्ययनदानानि तपः सत्यं क्षमा दमः । अलोभ इ꣡ति मार्गो ऽयम्</s>, ‘sacrificing, studying, liberality, penance, truth, patience, self-restraint, absence of desire’, this course of conduct, &c.) 
<div n="p"/><s>इ꣡ति</s> is sometimes followed by <s>एवम्</s>, <s>इव</s>, or a demonstrative pronoun pleonastically (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ताम् ब्रूयाद् भवती<स्र्स्꣡>त्य् एवम्</s>, her he may call ‘lady’, thus). 
<div n="p"/><s>इ꣡ति</s> may form an adverbial compound with the name of an author (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>इ꣡ति-पाणिनि</s>, thus according to <s1 slp1="pARini">Pāṇini</s1>). It may also express the act of calling attention (lo! behold!) It may have some other significations <ab>e.g.</ab> something additional (as in <s>इ꣡त्यादि</s>, et caetera), order, arrangement specific or distinctive, and identity. It is used by native commentators after quoting a rule to express ‘according to such a rule’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>अनुदात्तङित इ꣡त्य् आत्मनेपदम् भवति</s>, according to the rule of <s1 slp1="pARini">Pāṇini</s1>, <ls> i, 3, 12</ls>, the <s1 slp1="Atmane-pada">Ātmane-pada</s1> takes place). 
<div n="p"/> <s>किम् इ꣡ति</s> = <s>किम्</s>, wherefore, why? (In the <s1 slp1="SatapaTa-brAhmaRa">Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa</s1> <s>ति</s> occurs for <s>इ꣡ति</s>;
