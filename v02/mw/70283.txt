<hom>2.</hom> <s>च</s> ¦ <lex>ind.</lex> and, both, also, moreover, as well as (= <lang n="greek">τε</lang>, <ab>Lat.</ab> <etym>que</etym>, placed like these particles as an enclitic after the word which it connects with what precedes;
when used with a personal pronoun this must appear in its fuller accented form (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>त/व च म/म च</s> [not <s>ते च मे च</s>], ‘both of thee and me’), when used after verbs the first of them is accented, <ls>Pāṇ. 8-1, 58 f.</ls>;
it connects whole sentences as well as parts of sentences;
in <ls>RV.</ls> the double <s>च</s> occurs more frequently than the single (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>अह/ं च त्व/ं च</s>, ‘I and thou’, <ls>viii, 62, 11</ls>);
the double <s>च</s> may also be used somewhat redundantly in class. <ns>Sanskṛt</ns> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>क्व हरिणकानां जीवितं चा<srs/>तिलोलं क्व च वज्र-साराः शरास् ते</s>, ‘where is the frail existence, of fawns and where are thy adamantine arrows?’ <ls>Śak. i, 10</ls>);
in later literature, however, the first <s>च</s> is more usually omitted (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>अहं त्वं च</s>), and when more than two things are enumerated only one <s>च</s> is often found (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>तेजसा यशसा लक्ष्म्या स्थित्या च परया</s>, ‘in glory, in fame, in beauty, and in high position’ <ls>Nal. xii, 6</ls>);
elsewhere, when more than two things are enumerated, <s>च</s> is placed after some and omitted after others (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ऋण-दाता च वैद्यश् च श्रोत्रियो नदी</s>, ‘the payer of a debt and a physician [and] a <ns>Brāhman</ns> [and] a river’ <ls>Hit. i, 4, 55</ls>);
in <ab>Ved.</ab> and even in class. <ns>Sanskṛt</ns> [<ls>Mn. iii, 20;
ix, 322</ls>;
<ls>Hit.</ls>], when the double <s>च</s> would generally be used, the second may occasionally be omitted (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>इन्द्रश् च सोम</s>, ‘both <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1> [and thou] <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1>’ <ls>RV. vii, 104, 25</ls>;
<s>दुर्भेद्यश् चा<srs/>शुसंधेयः</s>, ‘both difficult to be divided [and] quickly united’ <ls>Hit. i</ls>);
with lexicographers <s>च</s> may imply a reference to certain other words which are not expressed (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>कमण्डलौ च करकः</s>, ‘the word <s>करक</s> has the meaning ‘pitcher’ and other meanings’);
sometimes <s>च</s> is = <s>एव</s>, even, indeed, certainly, just (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>सु-चिन्तितं चौ<srs/>षधं न नाम-मात्रेण करोत्य् अरोगम्</s>, ‘even a well-devised remedy does not cure a disease by its mere name’ <ls>Hit.</ls>;
<s>यावन्त एव ते तावांश्च सः</s>, ‘as great as they [were] just so great was he’ <ls>Ragh. xii, 45</ls>);
occasionally <s>च</s> is disjunctive, ‘but’, ‘on the contrary’, ‘on the other hand’, ‘yet’, ‘nevertheless’ (<s>वरम् आद्यौ न चा<srs/>न्तिमः</s>, ‘better the two first but not the last’ <ls>Hit.</ls> <pb n="380,2"/>;
<s>शान्तम् इदम् आश्रम-पदं स्फुरति च बाहुः</s>, ‘this hermitage is tranquil yet my arm throbs’ <ls>Śak. i, 15</ls>);
<s>च-च</s>, though-yet, <ls>Vikr. ii, 9</ls>;
<s>च-न च</s>, though - yet not, <ls>Pat.</ls>;
<s>च</s> - <s>न तु</s> (<ab>v.l.</ab> <s>ननु</s>) <ab>id.</ab>, <ls>Mālav. iv, 8</ls>;
<s>न च</s> - <s>च</s>, though not - yet, <ls>Pat.</ls>;
<s>च</s> may be used for <s>वा</s>, ‘either’, ‘or’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>इह चा<srs/>मुत्र वा</s>, ‘either here or hereafter’ <ls>Mn. xii, 89</ls>;
<s>स्त्री वा पुमान् वा यच् चा<srs/>न्यत् सत्त्वम्</s>, ‘either a woman or a man or any other being’ <ls>R.</ls>), and when a <ab>neg.</ab> particle is joined with <s>च</s> the two may then be translated by ‘neither’, ‘nor’;
occasionally one <s>च</s> or one <s>न</s> is omitted (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>न च परिभोक्तुं नै<srs/>व शक्नोमि हातुम्</s>, ‘I am able neither to enjoy nor to abandon’ <ls>Śak. v, 18</ls>;
<s>न पूर्वा<srs/>ह्णे न च परा<srs/>ह्णे</s>, ‘neither in the forenoon nor in the afternoon’);
<s>च-च</s> may express immediate connection between two acts or their simultaneous occurrence (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>मम च मुक्तं तमसा मनो मनसिजेन धनुषि शरश् च निवेशितः</s>, ‘no sooner is my mind freed from darkness than a shaft is fixed on his bow by the heart-born god’, <ls>vi, 8</ls>);
<s>च</s> is sometimes = <s>चे<srs/>द्</s>, ‘if’ (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Pāṇ. 8-1, 30</ls>;
the verb is accented), <ls>RV.</ls>;
<ls>AV.</ls>;
<ls>MBh.</ls>;
<ls>Vikr. ii, 20</ls>;
<ls>Bhartṛ. ii, 45</ls>;
<s>च</s> may be used as an expletive (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>अन्यैश् च क्रतुभिश् च</s>, ‘and with other sacrifices’);
<s>च</s> is often joined to an <ab>adv.</ab> like <s>एव</s>, <s>अपि</s>, <s>तथा</s>, <s>तथै<srs/>व</s>, &c., either with or without a <ab>neg.</ab> particle (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>वैरिणं नो<srs/>पसेवेत सहा<srs/>यं चैव वैरिणः</s>, ‘one ought not to serve either an enemy or the ally of an enemy’ <ls>Mn. iv, 133</ls>);
