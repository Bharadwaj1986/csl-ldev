¦ <s>क</s> is occasionally used alone as an indefinite pronoun, especially in negative sentences (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>न कस्य को वल्लभः</s>, no one is a favourite of any one;
<s>ना<srs/>न्यो जानाति कः</s>, no one else knows;
<s>कथं स घातयति कम्</s>, how does he kill any one?) Generally, however, <s>क</s> is only made indefinite when connected with the particles <s>च</s>, <s>चन/</s>, <s>चिद्</s>, <s>वा</s>, and <s>अ/पि</s>, in which case <s>क</s> may sometimes be preceded by the relative <s>य</s> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ये के च</s>, any persons whatsoever;
<s>यस्यै कस्यै च देवतायै</s>, to any deity whatsoever;
<s>यानि कानि च मित्राणि</s>, any friends whatsoever;
<s>यत् किंच</s>, whatever). 
The particle <s>चन</s>, being composed of <s>च</s> and <s>न</s>, properly gives a negative force to the pronoun (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>यस्माद् इन्द्राद् ऋते किंचन</s>, without which <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1> there is nothing), but the negative sense is generally dropped (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>कश्चन</s>, any one;
<s>न कश्चन</s>, no one), and a relative is sometimes connected with it (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>यत् किंचन</s>, anything whatsoever). Examples of <s>चिद्</s> with the interrogative are common <s>वा</s> and <s>अपि</s> are not so common, but the latter is often found in classical <ns>Sanskṛt</ns> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>कश्चिद्</s>, any one;
<s>केचिद्</s>, some;
<s>न कश्चिद्</s>, no one;
<s>न किंचिद् अपि</s>, nothing whatsoever;
<s>यः कश्चिद्</s>, any one whatsoever;
<s>केचित्</s> - <s>केचित्</s>, some - others;
<s>यस्मिन् कस्मिन् वा देशे</s>, in any country whatsoever;
<s>न को ऽपि</s>, no one;
<s>न किमपि</s>, nothing whatever). <s>क</s> may sometimes be used, like 2. <s>कद्</s>, at the beginning of a compound. See <s>क-पूय</s>, &c.
