¦ This particle may serve to give emphasis, like <s>इद्</s> and <s>एव</s>, especially after prepositions or demonstrative pronouns, in conjunction with <s>नु</s>, <s>वै</s>, <s>हि</s>, <s>चिद्</s>, &c. (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>अय꣡म् उ वाम् पुरुत꣡मो</s>... <s>जोहवीति</s> [<ls>RV. iii, 62, 2</ls>], this very person [your worshipper] invokes you &c.) It is especially used in the figure of speech called Anaphora, and particularly when the pronouns are repeated (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>त꣡म् उ स्तुष इ꣡न्द्रम् त꣡म् गृणीषे</s> [<ls>RV. ii, 20, 4</ls>], him I praise, <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1>, him I sing). It may be used in drawing a conclusion, like the English ‘now’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>त꣡द् उ त꣡था न꣡ कुर्यात्</s> [<ls>ŚBr. v, 2, 2, 3</ls>], that now he should not do in such a manner), and is frequently found in interrogative sentences (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>क꣡ उ त꣡च् चिकेत</s> [<ls>RV. i, 164, 48</ls>], who, I ask, should know that?)<info lex="inh"/>
