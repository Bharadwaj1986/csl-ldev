¦ The interrogative sentence introduced by <s>क</s> is often terminated by <s>इति</s> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>कस्य स पुत्र इति कथ्यताम्</s>, let it be said, ‘whose son is he?’), but <s>इति</s> may be omitted and the sentence lose its direct interrogative character (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>कस्य स पुत्रो न ज्ञायते</s>, it is not known whose son he is). 
<s>क</s> with or without √ <hom>1.</hom> <s>अस्</s> may express ‘how is it possible that?’ ‘what power have I, you, they, &c.?’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>के मम धन्विनोऽन्ये</s>, what can the other archers do against me? <s>के आवाम् परित्रातुम्</s>, what power have we to rescue you?) 
<s>क</s> is often connected with a demonstrative <ab>pron.</ab> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>को ऽयम् आयाति</s>, who comes here?) or with the potential (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>को हरिं निन्देत्</s>, who will blame <s1 slp1="hari">Hari</s1>?) 
<s>क</s> is sometimes repeated (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>कः को ऽत्र</s>, who is there? <s>कान् कान्</s>, whom? whom? <ab>i.e.</ab> which of them? <ab>cf.</ab> Gram. 54), and the repetition is often due to a kind of attraction (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>केषां किं शास्त्रम् अध्ययनीयम्</s>, which book is to be read by whom? Gram. 836. <s>अ</s>). 
When <s>किम्</s> is connected with the inst. <ab>c.</ab> of a noun or with the <ab n="indeclinable">indecl.</ab> participle it may express ‘what is gained by doing so, &c.?’ (= <s>कोऽर्थस्</s>);
(<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>किं विलम्बेन</s>, what is gained by delay? <s>किम् बहुना</s>, what is the use of more words? <s>धनेन किं यो न ददाति</s>, what is the use of wealth to him who does not give? with inst. and <ab>gen.</ab>, <s>नीरुजः किम् औषधैः</s>, what is the use of medicine to the healthy?)
