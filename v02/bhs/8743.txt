{@Pakṣu@}¦, n. of a nāga king: °ur Mvy 3307. Cf. {@Vakṣu@}.
Tib. Pag-śu. But it seems to be a river-name; the three
preceding names are Gaṅgā-, Sindhur, and Sītā-nāgarājā;
similarly in MSV i.164.1. (Nāgas are often thought of as
living in rivers, as is well known; cf. Mvy 3304--6.) Since
Vakṣu occurs as n. of a river in Skt., it is probably the
correct form.
