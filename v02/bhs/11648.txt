{@maharddhika@}¦, f. {@°kā@}, Bhvr. adj. (= Pali mahiddhika,
acc. to PTSD ‘always’ with mahānubhāva, but this is
not true, see e.g. Pv i.10.1; Mahāvaṃsa 1.39), {%of great%}
{%supernatural power%} (ṛddhi), or more loosely, {%of great power,%}
{%majesty%}, or perhaps (as in Skt.) {%of great wealth%}; with
mahānubhāva, of ṛṣis, Mv ii.49.1; 96.1, 3; of a gṛhapati,
Divy 277.28 ff.; said of Buddha(s), Mv i.294.22; Av
ii.199.13; of deities, Mv i.305.1; iii.302.4; Kv 10.15; Suv
101.9 (lokapālas); of Māra, said by himself, Mv ii.276.19;
of miscellaneous persons, Mv ii.92.17; iii.1.3; 63.18;
sometimes as final member of a cpd., the prior member
denoting the class of being so designated (this usage not
recorded in Pali): devamaharddhikā vā devā vā nāga-°kā
vā nāgā vā etc. (long series of similar terms) Gv 75.3;
[Page421-b+ 71]
esp. preta-°ka, said of a class of pretas whose position
as such has been mitigated, though not completely relieved,
either by their own actions or by merit transferred to
them by others (see {@dakṣiṇādeśanā@}), Divy 14.19; Av
i.264.16 ff.; 273.1; even these pretas may still manifest
evil propensities, Av i.265.8 ff.; altho the cpd. *peta-
mahiddhika seems not to occur in Pali, the adj. mahid-
dhikā is used of a petī who, like the pretas so described
in BHS, was enjoying partial happiness because of some
merit acquired, Pv. 1.10.1.
