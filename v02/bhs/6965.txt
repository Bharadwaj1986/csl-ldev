{@tiryak@}¦, adv. (used in the sense of Pali tiro, BHS
{@tiras, tiraskṛta@}, q.v.; the converse use of Skt. tiras in
the sense of tiryak, {%crosswise%}, is recorded by BR s.v. 2a
from lexicons, and once in Mārk. Pur.; but in this one
passage it seems to me that tiras may have its Pali mg.
of {%outside, away, afar%}), {%outside, away, afar%}, in contrast
with iha; neha na tiryak nobhayam antarā Śikṣ 252.15,
{%not here, not afar, not between the two%}. (Bendall and Rouse,
Transl. 234 line 2, {%across%}; but this seems manifest nonsense
in the context.)
