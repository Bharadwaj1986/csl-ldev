{@ajanya@}¦ (cf. Pali ajañña), prob. {%ignoble, debased%}:
ajanyasya brāhmaṇasya putro Mv i.319.12; 321.16; 323.7;
said of Jyotipāla; since he was a friend of a potter's son,
[Page007-b+ 71]
his father may have been an outcaste brahman. Senart
assumes mg. {%noble%}, on grounds which I find unconvincing
The mg. I assume fits the Pali ajañña, Jāt, ii.437.17
In Mv iii.119.23 prob. read with v.l. anajanyarathā, {%not%}
{%ignoble chariots%}, for ajanya° of text. (Meter is bad in either
case.) In Kv 42.10 for na jatyeṣu read perhaps nājanyeṣu,
{%not among ignoble people%}; see s.v. {@jatya@}.
