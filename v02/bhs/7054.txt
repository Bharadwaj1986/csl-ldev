{@taila-pācikam@}¦, adv., in °kaṃ vā kriyamāṇasya Śikṣ
182.1, in a list of tortures, looks etymologically as if it
might mean {%(or of one being made to be) boiled in oil%}, but
acc. to note in ed., Chin. {%making mincemeat of one%} (perhaps
°ka is the name of some dish, of chopped meat fried in oil?).
Cf. next.
