{@Upāriṣṭa@}¦ (once printed Upa°, prob. by error, despite
the Pali equivalent Upariṭṭha; Chin. on Karmav {%sans mal%},
see Lévi's note), n. of a pratyekabuddha: Mmk 40.23
(prose; dvau pratyekabuddhau gandhamādanaḥ) upāriṣṭaś
ceti; 64.12 (prose)…upariṣṭa…(so printed here, in a
list of pr. b.); 111.10 (prose, in list of 8 pr. b.) candanaḥ
gandhamādanaḥ ketuḥ suketu sitaketu ṛṣṭa upāriṣṭa
nemiś ceti; Karmav 67.1, where Lévi prints Upariṣṭha
in text, but apparently without ms. authority; in his
note he says, read Upāriṣṭa with one ms. (the other is
corrupt but begins apā-, indicating ā in second syllable).
