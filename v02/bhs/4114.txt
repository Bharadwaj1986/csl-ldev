{@ettāvat-@}¦, in cpd (= Skt. etāvat, cf. prec.; Pali adv.
ettāvatā), {%to this extent%}, noted only in Mv ii.130.8, 11.
where mss. are corrupt but Senart's text and interpretation
are certainly wrong; read probably, ettāvatpāram ito
imaṃ pi kecit nābhisaṃbhuṇanti. or possibly nāpi sam°
(they experience pains) {%to so great an extent as this, and%}
{%after this%} (ito; cf. Pali parallel, MN i.246.22, 25 etāva-
paramaṃ na-y-ito bhiyvo; also parallel LV 263.8 etāvat-
paramam te duhkham anubhavanti) {%some do not attain%}
[Page156-a+ 71]
{%even this%} (degree of success; said of ascetics who practise
self-torture). At any rate, divide ettāvatpāram from ito
(Senart °pāramite).
