{@dharma-kāya@}¦, m. (in Pali recorded only as Bhvr.
adj. in quite different sense, {%having a body that is, or is%}
{%characterized by, the Doctrine%}, DN iii.84.24, said of the
Buddha; see below for similar use in BHS); ({@1@}) {%the mass%}
{%of conditions of existence%}, see s.v. {@kāya@} (2); ({@2@}) perhaps
to be rendered {%spiritual body (?)%}, contrasted with {@rūpa-@}
{@kāya@}, q.v.: (dṛṣṭo mayopādhyāyānubhāvena) sa bhagavān
dharmakāyena ({%in his spiritual form%}, or the like; he had
not seen him physically) no tu rūpakāyena ({%but not in his%}
{%physical form%}) Divy 19.11; similarly 360.19 (…na dṛṣṭo
rūpakāyo me 20--21); na rūpakāyatas tathāgataḥ prajñā-
tavyaḥ…dharmakāyaprabhāvitāś ca buddhā bhagavanto
na rūpakāya-prabhāvitāḥ Samādh 22.7 (Régamey, {%Absolute%}
{%Body, Material Body%}; R. does not understand prabhāvita
quite rightly; it means {%recognized%}, see BR s.v. bhū with
pra, caus., 3); similarly 22.9 and esp. 34, with the explana-
tion, dharmeṇa kāyu nirjito, (His) {%body is born%} (? see
{@nirjita@}) {%by dharma%}; see Régamey p. 23; elsewhere, with
the same contrast, the word dharma-k° is used as a Bhvr.
adj. (cf. the Pali usage above, with which this usage may
be directly connected), na hi tathāgato rūpakāyato
draṣṭavyaḥ, dharmakāyās tathāgatāḥ AsP 513.15; instead
of rūpakāya, simply kāya may be used in contrast, dharma-
kāyā buddhā bhagavantaḥ, mā khalu punar imaṃ bhik-
ṣavaḥ satkāyaṃ kāyaṃ manyadhvaṃ, dharmakāya-
pariniṣpattito māṃ bhikṣavo drakṣyanty AsP 94.11--13;
({@3@}) perhaps to be rendered in the same way as (2), but
considered the highest of three {%bodies%} of a Buddha, the
[Page277-b+ 71]
others being {@saṃbhoga-@} and {@nirmāṇa-k°@}; this is a
late formula (Régamey, l.c. above) and I have noted the
triad only in Mvy 116--118 among texts included in this
work (see under the others); ({@4@}) without specific contrast
with other kāyas but most likely belonging to (2) rather
than (3): sa dharmakāya-prabhāvito (see Samādh 22.7
above) darśanenāpi sattvānām arthaṃ karoti Śikṣ. 159.7;
manomaya-dharmakāyasya tathāgatasya Laṅk 192.1
(AbhidhK. knows a manomaya-kāya, app. not identified
with dharma-k°, see LaV-P. Index; acc. to ii.209 it pertains
to the rūpa-dhātu); prob., na rājan kṛpaṇo loke dharma-
kāyena saṃspṛśet Divy 560.2 (vs). [In LV 401.21 all
mss. and Calc. read Dharmakāya as n. of one of the four
devatās of the bodhi-tree; Lefm. {@Dharmakāma@}, with
Tib. chos ḥdod; the em. seems plausible.]
