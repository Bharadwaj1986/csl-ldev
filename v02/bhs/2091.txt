{@? avadhya@}¦, adj., ep. of śilpa, {%art%}, in LV 23.21 avadhya-
śilpa-niveśanaṃ (kulam, in which the Bodhisattva is
reborn for the last time); so all Lefm.'s mss., but he trans-
lates {%nützlichen (freien) Künsten zugetan%}, prob. following
Tib. don yod pa (which once renders amogha, {%unfailing%},
see Das), {%useful, successful%}. Calc. reads abandhya (i.e.
avandhya, {%not barren%}); I suspect that this should be
adopted. But cf. next but one.
