{@Khadiravanika@}¦ (cf. Pali Khadiravaniya, there
another name for {@Revata@}, q.v., who in both LV and Sukh
is mentioned as a distinct personage immediately before
Kha° in the same list), n. of a disciple of the Buddha:
LV 2.1 (v.l. °vadika, but Tib. confirms text); Sukh 2.9;
Mvy 1066. Is it significant that Mvy does not mention
Revata ?
