{@adhimukti@}¦, f. (= Pali adhimutti; to {@adhimucyate@}),
({@1@}) {%strong inclination, attachment; earnest, zealous applica-%}
{%tion%}; Tib. mos pa (Jäschke, {%to be pleased%}, la {%with; to wish,%}
{%to have a mind; to take pleasure in, to rejoice at%}; as substan-
tive {%pleasure, satisfaction, esteem%}; also {%to respect, to esteem,%}
{%to respect with devotion, to revere, to adore%}); La V-P. AbhidhK.
Index = ruci; cf. Bbh 95.12--13 kathaṃ ca bodhisattvo
'dhimuktibahulo bhavati? iha bodhisattvo 'ṣṭavidhe
'dhimuktyadhiṣṭhāne śraddhāprasādapūrvakeṇa niścayena
{%rucyā%} samanvāgato bhavati.(Other alleged meanings, as
{%croyance%} Lévi Sūtrāl. i.13 note 1; {%confiance%}, Burnouf;
{%good will%}, Kern, in translation of SP; etc., are not supported
by BHS usage, except as under 2, below.) It may be (but
rarely is) applied to (a) non-religious objects: sa ca puruṣas
(the father) teṣāṃ kumārakāṇām (his ignorant sons)
āśayajño bhaved, adhimuktiṃ ca vijānīyāt, SP 73.14--15,
…{%and he understands their inclinations, what they are%}
{%interested in%}. But usually the object is related to (b) a
religious aim. It may be specified, syntactically (in the
loc.), as in yaṃ…sugataḥ prabhāṣate, adhimuktisaṃ-
panna bhavāhi tatra SP 32.15, {%what the Buddha says,%}
{%be perfect in zealous application to that%}. Usually it is not so
specifically stated, tho the context is apt to suggest that
it is {%zealous cultivation%} (study or propagation) of sacred
texts or religious instruction that is meant (note-that
the object of the verb {@adhimucyate@} is commonly some-
thing of this sort); cf. e.g. -lokaṃ yathādhimuktyā
({%according to their%} [varying types or degrees of] {%zeal or%}
{%application%}) subhāṣitena saṃtoṣayantam LV 160.17;
adhimuktisāro yo syād…saḥ, puṇyaṃ labheta yo etaṃ
(most mss.) sūtraṃ vācel likheta vā SP 342.3--4. And this
is probably meant as a rule when the context gives no
special clue, as in many of the following: SP 6.13; 31.6;
93.9; 125.8; 235.10; 274.10; LV 10.11; 182.20; 432.8;
Mvy 856; Samādh 22.43; RP 20.5; Bhad 7, 48; Bbh 195.12;
anadhimukti, {%lack of%} (religious) {%zeal%} RP 19.18; 35.4;
various gods in Mv ii.309.14 ff. see the bodhi-tree svakāye
adhmuktīye, {%according to their tastes, inclinations, interests%}
(Senart {%suivant l'inclination de chacun%}) as made of various
[Page014-b+ 71]
precious materials; one of the ten bala of a tathāgata is
nānādhimuktijñānabala Mvy 122 (and cf. Mv i.159.15
adhimuktinānātvaṃ vetti, as one of the ten bala); adhi-
muktivaśitā Mvy 776, one of the 10 vaśitā of a Bodhisattva;
yathādhimuktyā, adv., LV 160.17 (above) and 179.17;
hīnādhimukti, {%attachment to low ends%}, SP 115.12 (cf.
hīnādhimukta, °tika, s.vv. {@adhimukta, °tika@}); (in LV
294.4 for vidyādhimuktiprabhaḥ read probably vidyāvi-
mukti°, {%having the splendor of%} (true) {%knowledge and emancipa-%}
{%tion%}, so Tib., rnam par grol ba = vimukti); ({@2@}) {%magic%}
{%transformation%}, in adhimukti-balena LV 385.5, see s.v.
