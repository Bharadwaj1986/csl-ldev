{@uṣṇīṣa, (1)@}¦ nt. (in Skt. also m.; = Pali uṇhīsa), in
Skt. only {%turban%}; in cpd. uṣṇīṣa-śīrṣa(n) or -śiras(ka), 32d
of the 32 {@lakṣaṇa@}, q.v. (Pali uṇhīsa-sīsa), acc. to Pali
DN comm. ii.452.1 ff. {%having a head the size and shape of%}
{%which makes it seem turbanned%}. But in BHS (and Pali)
interpreted as {%having a head surmounted by an excrescence%},
whether a top-knot of hair, or a growth in the skull. So
Tib. regularly (uṣṇīṣa = gtsug tor), e.g. on Mvy 236
uṣṇīṣa-śiraska-tā. Confirmed by Gv 401.26 ff. mūrdhni

Cf. also {@uṣṇi@}, apparently = uṣṇīṣa in this sense, and
{@uṣṇiṣa@}. In comp. as one of the lakṣaṇa, LV 105.11;
432.13; Dharmas 83; Mv i.227.3; ii.30.6; 307.4; Bbh
376.7; ({@2@}) m., one of ten {@Krodha:@} Dharmas 11; ({@3@}) in
Mmk 41.7 aṣṭau uṣṇīṣarājānaḥ are mentioned as to be
depicted in a rite; their names, given 41.10--11, are Cakra-
vartin, Uṣṇīṣa, Abhyudgatoṣṇīṣa, Sitātapatra, Jayoṣṇīṣa,
Kamaloṣṇīṣa, Tejorāśi, Unnatoṣṇīṣa. They seem not to
be related to the Krodha of Dharmas 11, tho the first
two names also occur in that list. Nothing significant is
said of them.
