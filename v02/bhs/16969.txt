{@Sunirmita, (1)@}¦ m. (= Pali Sunimmita, cf. DN
i.219.4), n. of the chief of the {@nirmāṇarati@} (also called
{@nirmita@}) gods: LV 44.10; 59.6; 302.6; 362.18; 363.19;
441.18; Mv i.208.13; 263.16; ii.11.1; iii.315.7; Divy 140.15;
Mmk 45.8; 69.6; Bbh 345.22 (in Mvy {@Sunirmāṇarati@},
q.v.); most occurrences which seem to suggest use in pl.,
as of the class of nirmita (= nirmāṇarati) gods, are only
apparent, see s.v. {@Suyāma@} for a number of cases in Gv,
Dbh.g., and RP. However, I have noted two cases where
the pl. seems unquestionable (unless we resort to emenda-
tion), and can only mean the class of which (the sg.)
Sunirmita is chief: sunirmitāṃ devaputrāṃ paśyati ca
svalaṃkṛtāṃ Mv ii.360.4 (vs); and, in a list of classes
of gods, …sunirmitā paranirmitā śuddhāvāsā tuṣitā
yāmā… Mmk 19.12 (prose). (But in LV 241.2, for
Sunirmiteṣu, read with best ms. Sunirmito sa, supported
by Tib.) Perhaps the fact that nirmita is used of the class,
but less regularly than nirmāṇarati, led to occasional
confusion with the name of its chieftain: ({@2@}) nt., n. of a
buddhakṣetra: Mv i.123.6 (vs); located in the east.
