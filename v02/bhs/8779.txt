{@paṭa@}¦, m. (rarely nt.), ({@1@}) {%cloth%}, as in Skt., seemingly
in very general sense: in Mvy 5864, 9168 Tib. snam bu,
which is said to mean {%woolen cloth%} (contrast paṭaka Mvy
9169); in SP 75.7 (prose) both Burnouf (who reads paṭṭa,
see his note p. 369--370) and Kern translate {%silk%}; the word
is cpd. with prec. {@duṣya-@} or {@dūṣya-@}, q.v.; B. and K.
regard the cpd. as a dvandva, but it is surely a karmadh.,
meaning some kind of {%fine cloth%} (see {@duṣya@}); in Kv 81.6 f.
(likewise in Mv ii.157.7) it also means {%cloth%} in general,
as used to garb persons initiated in various religious orders,
see s.v. {@indra-paṭa; (2)@} in Mv iii.31.11 apparently {%piece,%}
{%fragment%} (of a stone; cf. Skt. paṭati, {%splits%}), if the text is
right: (upalānāṃ) paṭaṃ (so mss., Senart paṭāṃ) chittvā,
{%splitting off a piece of the stones%}; ({@3@}) in LV 315.15 (vs)
assumed to be a kind of bird, but reading uncertain; Lefm.
[Page316-a+ 71]
vīkṣasva bodhimaṇḍe paṭukroñcāhaṃsakokilamayūrāḥ,
with v.l. paṭa for paṭu; Calc. paṭa-; Tib. pa ta kun ta
(presumably understanding it as n. of a single bird) for
paṭa(or paṭu-)kroñca (the rest of the cpd. is correctly ren-
dered in Tib.); neither paṭa nor paṭu seems to be known
as a bird-name; if paṭu is right, could it not be taken as
adv. with vīkṣasva ? {%look keenly, sharply, at the…%}; [({@4@}) on
LV 127.17 for paṭopachedana read vaṭṭopa°, supported
by best ms. and Pali; see s.v. {@vaṭṭa@}.]
