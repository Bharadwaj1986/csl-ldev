{@upalabhyate, °ti@}¦ (in mg. 1 = Pali upalabbhati, pass.
of upa-labh, much commoner than the act.): ({@1@}) {%is found,%}
{%occurs%}, like Skt. vidyate. This mg. seems probable in KP
98.1, where for corrupt text read prob. nobhayayor
antarāle upalabhyate, or perh. with the quotation Śikṣ
234.2 nobhayam antareṇopa°; and KP 102.1--2 yan na
labhyate tan nopalabhyate, {%what is not found, does not%}
{%occur (exist?)%}; it must however be noted that Tib. renders
mi dmigs pa, {%is not conceived mentally, fancied%} (see under
{@upalambha@}); ({@2@}) {%is upbraided, reproached%}: Mv iii.291.16
°yati; 295.13 °yamāno; no v.l., but as Senart notes, this
is the regular mg. of Skt. upālabhyate; perhaps read upā°,
but note the curious fact that Das cites a Tib. dmigs
paḥi (regularly = upa-labh and derivatives!) smra
({%speech%}), defined by {%execration, reviling%} (apavāda)!
