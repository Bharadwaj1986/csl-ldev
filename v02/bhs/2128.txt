({@avamardita-cittam@}¦, SP 108.5, rendered by Kern
{%mentally developed%}; similarly Burnouf. But Skt. avamardati
and Pali omaddati mean only {%distress%} or the like. The
form means {%having his spirit depressed, crushed%}; note that
it {%follows%} viditvā; it is not parallel with the words preceding
viditvā, but is modified by the following udārasaṃjñayā;
the phrase is explained by what follows.)
