{@? caṅkramya-yuktāḥ@}¦ SP 13.2 (vs), so both edd.,
as cpd.; perh. Tib. understood it so, ḥchag pa byed ciṅ,
{%making wandering%} (no other rendering for yuktāḥ in Tib.);
if so, we must assume an otherwise unknown noun caṅ-
kramya = caṅkrama(ṇa), {%wandering%} (based on the normal
Skt. pres. caṅkramya-te = BHS {@caṅkramati@} ?). Burnouf
clearly understood caṅkramya as separate word, ger. to
{@caṅkramati@}; Kern {%actively engaged in walking%}, which is
ambiguous but suggests rather a cpd.
