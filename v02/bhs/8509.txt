{@? niśāṭhaka@}¦ or {@niśāthaka@}, in: kalaha-raṇa-°kā(ḥ)
<div n="lb">Mv i.176.6--7, ep. of Buddhas; clearly corrupt; Senart em.
<div n="lb">niśātakā, rendering {%(sharp =) redoubtable in%} (spiritual)
<div n="lb">{%fights and battles%}. But niśāta is not recorded in this use,
<div n="lb">and moreover I question such a complimentary fig. use
<div n="lb">of kalaha-raṇa. It seems more likely that some deriv. of
<div n="lb">niśāmyati, {%is pacified%}, is involved; a caus. to this would
<div n="lb">mean {%quieters%} (of strife and evil). Possibly niśāmakā(ḥ)?
