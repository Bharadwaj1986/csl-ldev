{@? niśāṭhaka@}¦ or {@niśāthaka@}, in: kalaha-raṇa-°kā(ḥ)
Mv i.176.6--7, ep. of Buddhas; clearly corrupt; Senart em.
niśātakā, rendering {%(sharp =) redoubtable in%} (spiritual)
{%fights and battles%}. But niśāta is not recorded in this use,
and moreover I question such a complimentary fig. use
of kalaha-raṇa. It seems more likely that some deriv. of
niśāmyati, {%is pacified%}, is involved; a caus. to this would
mean {%quieters%} (of strife and evil). Possibly niśāmakā(ḥ)?
