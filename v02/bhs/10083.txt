{@pratilayana@}¦, (app. to Skt. prati-lī-, Pali paṭilīyati,
{%withdraws, turns back%}, and derivs.), should mean {%with-%}
{%drawal%} (from), {%non-adherence%} (to): only in Gv 494.18, said
of bodhicittam, (sārathibhūtaṃ) mahāyāna-pratilayana-
pūrvaṃgamana-tayā; it seems probable that the true text
was mahāyānāprati°, with neg., {%it acts like a charioteer%}
{%because of the fact that it is accompanied%} ({%conditioned%}, see
{@pūrvaṃgamana@}) {%by not withdrawing (holding back) from%}
{%the Great Vehicle%}.
