{@daśabala@}¦, adj. (= Pali dasa°), {%possessing the ten bala%},
ep. and synonym of (any) Buddha, often used in the same
way as tathāgata, jina, etc.: Mvy 25; (yo dadyā jambudvī-
paṃ saptaratnasaṃcayaṃ) daśabalānāṃ Mv i.80.7, {%who%}
{%gives…to the Buddhas%}: similarly 8; 116.2, etc.; in Divy
275.5, 7 daśabala Kāśyapa (as either two words or one)
[Page263-a+ 71]
refers to a monk in Śākyamuni's entourage (not to the
former Buddha Kāśyapa, who acc. to PTSD and DPPN
was ‘especially’ called daśabala, a statement for which
I have found no evidence; in BHS, at any rate, daśabala
applies equally to any and every Buddha); see s.v.
{@Kāśyapa@} (2).
