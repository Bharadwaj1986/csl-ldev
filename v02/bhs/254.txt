(2 {@añjana:@}¦ mṛgo…raktehi khurehi añjanehi akṣīhi
prabhāsvarehi darśanīyehi Mv i.363.18. No v.l.; but there
is no authority for añjana as adj. [PTSD quotes 3 Jāt.
passages for this, all erroneous.] Senart suggests sāñjanehi
or equivalent. But perhaps render: {%with red hoofs and eyes%}
{%bright and beautiful%} (as if?) {%with collyrium%}.)
