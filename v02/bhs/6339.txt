{@cetaḥparyāya@}¦, m., {%way of thought, manner of mind%};
less often citta-pa°; commonly preceded by para- or
parasya, {%of others%}; knowledge of {%other's mental make-up%}
is one of the {@abhijñā@}, q.v.; so also in Pali, where Buddha
is parassa (para-) ceto-(citta-)-pariyāya-kusala (-kovida),
as one of the abhiññā. In Bhīk 27a.5 cetaḥparyāyasya is
not preceded by para- or equivalent, but the meaning is
certainly the same, since other abhijñā precede and follow
it (divyasya śrotrasya, pūrvanivāsasya). In Mv iii.321.13
Buddhas are called cetaḥparyāyasaṃpannāḥ, probably
also with implication of para-, tho here most of the other
abhijñā are not listed; but the next following epithet is
ṛddhiprātihāryasaṃpannā(ḥ), which recalls one of them.
