{@Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa@}¦, acc. to Bhattacharya, GOS 26
p. viii, n. of a Bodhisattva, ‘the principal figure in the
Tantra of that name’: Sādh 171.15, 172.2 etc. Is he not
another name for, or form of, Mañjuśrī? His sādhanas
follow those of the latter in Sādh; both have the name
or epithet {@Pañcavīra@} (read {@°cīra@})-{@kumāra@}, q.v. He is in
any case an angry personage.
