2 {@duṣya, dūṣya@}¦, nt. (= Pali dussa; see also {@kalpa-d°@}),
a kind of cloth, apparently of cotton but of fine quality;
see valuable note of Thomas ap. Hoernle MR 138 n.12
(on Kashgar fragment of SP 329.3), with examples of uses
to which it is put in Pali and BHS (dress of laymen and
women, not monks; wrapping of corpses; spreads on
chairs, and floors; curtains). Spellings with u and ū seem
both to occur in mss., but editions are exceptionally
confusing. Even the usually so reliable Senart always
prints (kalpa-)duṣya, but in his Index reads (kalpa-)dūṣya,
without explanation and without citing any v.l. in the
Crit. App. In SP usually and in LV only dūṣya is printed;
Lefm.'s mss. of LV often read duṣya, or corruptly puṣpa
or the like. Recorded duṣya(m) Mvy 5876 (so also Mironov;
BR dū°) = Tib. ras bcos bu, said to mean {%calico%}; duṣyāṇi
Mv i.251.14; duṣya (various forms) Mv i.216.13 = ii.19.10;
i.227.14; 236.4; Divy 614.17 (mss.); RP 41.2 f. and 56.15
(ms., Finot em. dū°); Suv 126.18 (no ms. has dū°); SP
89.4; Śikṣ 76.12; duṣya-yuga, see below, Mv i.61.1; 331.12;
on the other hand, dūṣya SP 75.7 ({@-paṭa@}, q.v.); 243.6
(-paṭṭa); 283.10; 331.6; LV 77.14, 187.13; 284.13; 368.5
(misprinted dūṣpa), Suv 7.8 (but so only 1 ms., the rest
du°); Divy 297.23; Gv 22.3: dūṣya-yuga, see Thomas loc.
cit., {%a double piece of d°%} (two lengths), SP 119.9; LV 159.12;
or, dūṣya-yugma, id., SP 329.3; in Kv 78.22 and 81.7
reap duṣya (or dūṣya) for {@dhyuṣita@}, q.v.
