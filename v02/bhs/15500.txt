1 {@sakhila@}¦, adj. (= Pali id.; cf. {@sākhilya@} and 1 {@akhila@}),
{%soft, smooth%}, once of (a garment of) cloth: sakhilā khu-d-
ayaṃ…karpāsānāṃ paṭapilotikasaṃghāṭī, mṛdukā-d-
ayaṃ…(same words), masinā-d-ayaṃ…, sukhumā-d-
ayaṃ…, tanukā-d-ayaṃ…, etc., Mv iii.53.17; this proves
that the usual interpretation, {%friendly%}, cannot be right;
it is of course based on the assumption of derivation from
sakhi, but this is proved wrong by the Mv passage; other-
wise recorded in Pali and BHS only of speech, esp. the
Buddha's; in Pali regularly assoc. with saṇha = ślakṣṇa
and mudu = mṛdu; sakhilo glossed muduvacano DN
comm. i.287.3 ff., and all comms. agree essentially on this,
as well as on sākhalya, sākhalla (= {@sākhilya@}), which is
the opposite of pharusa(-vācā etc.), e.g. Dhs. 1343; DN
comm. iii.981.15--22; sākhallena Jāt. iv.57.5, glossed
maṭṭhavacanena (note that maṭṭha is also applied to fine
cloth, -sāṭaka Vism. 284.13); the mg. therefore is {%smooth%},
and of speech {%suave, mild, gentle%}: Buddhasya sakhilā girā
Mv i.314.12 (vs), repeated below; su-sakhila-ślakṣṇa-vākyo
ii.395.5; sakhilā Mvy 495, in list of epithets of Buddha's
speech, = Tib. chub pa (? acc. to Das {%accomplished,%}
{%perfected%}; Chin. seems to mean {%affecting the hearts of all%}
{%creatures%}); of other (pious) persons, sūrataḥ (mss. su°)
sakhilo mṛduḥ Mv ii.371.8 (vs); su-sakhila-vācā iii.280.19
(vs, by em.); saṃmodako sakhilo ślakṣṇavāco (mss. °cā)
iii.372.4 (vs). The etym. of the word is obscure; BHS
{@akhila@} = paruṣa, {%harsh%} (of speech), suggests interpretation
as sa-khila, but may of course be a case of popular etym.;
no meaning of khila is known which would seem to fit.
