{@udyāma@}¦, m. (cf. Vedic id., the mg. of which in some
places, ŚB 8.5.1.13, is not clear), in sūtrodyāmaḥ Divy
643.1 = 644.9, perhaps {%extension, drawing out%} (of thread),
see s.v. {@tatkṣaṇa@}; but the precise meaning of the phrase
escapes me. It may mean {%effort, exertion%} (Skt. udyama),
as in Aśokan u(y)yāma, Rock Ed. (Kalsi) 13.18. In this
sense probably read nir-udyāmā, as suggested by Kashgar
rec., SP 100.9 (prose).
