{@prabandha@}¦, m. (Skt., {%continuation, continuity%}), in
Laṅk 37.10 ff., 38.5 ff., 39.3, seems to be nearly a synonym
[Page382-a+ 71]
for pravṛtti (which occurs as var. for it in one ms. 39.3;
see {@pravṛtti-vijñāna@}), {%continuous activity%} or {%existence%},
viz. of vijñāna, contrasted with lakṣaṇa, the {%external mark%}
or {%manifested aspect%} (Suzuki, Studies, 183) of vijñāna;
both must be subjected to suppression (nirodha); 38.5 f.
prabandha-nirodhaḥ…yasmān na (so, with Tib.) pra-
vartate, {%as a result of which it no longer operates%}; the pra-
bandha of vijñāna is analogous to the relation between
atoms of clay and a Jump of clay composed of them,
‘neither different nor not different’, 38.9 ff.
