{@tilakocavaka@}¦, nt., a kind of {%arrowhead%}: Mvy 6099
(in a list of weapons); acc. to Tib. (mde ḥu zur bzhi pa)
and Jap., {%an arrowhead with four edges%} or {%blades%}; Chin.
{%arrowhead with four layers (?)%}. I see no etymology for the
word; Skt. tila plus BHS {@kocavaka@}, q.v., seems to make
no sense.
