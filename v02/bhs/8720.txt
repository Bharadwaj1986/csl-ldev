{@nau-krama@}¦, m., Divy 55.17, 19, or {@nau-saṃkrama@},
m., Divy 55.24 ff.; 386.10; Av i.64.1, 5; 66.3; acc. to Divy
Index and Speyer's Index to Av, {%bridge of boats%} (joined
together): e.g. naukramo māpitaḥ Divy 55.17, 19. But
this interpretation is difficult in Divy 386.(9--)10, (nauyāne-
nāgamiṣyatīti yāvac ca Mathurāṃ) yāvac ca Pāṭaliputram
antarān nausaṃkramo 'vasthāpitaḥ, {%thinking, ‘he will come%}
{%by boat,’ established a boat-course from Mathurā as far as%}
{%Pāṭaliputra%}. Not only is this a long distance for a ‘bridge
of boats’, but in line 12, as a result of this arrangement,
Upagupta {%mounts on a ship%} (nāvam abhiruhya) and pro-
ceeds to Pāṭaliputra. Here, at least, the mg. seems then
to be {%course for boats, water-way, navigable passage for%}
{%ships%}; and this is possible in all the other passages.
