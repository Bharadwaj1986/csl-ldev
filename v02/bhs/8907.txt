{@param@}¦, indecl. (nowhere recorded; Skt. paramam is
so used), particle of assent, esp. to a command, {%assuredly,%}
{%certainly%}: Divy 288.13; 292.24; 293.8; 390.1; 407.29;
460.3; in LV 102.9 (prose) Lefm. parameti, with all his
mss., read surely param iti with Calc., supported in sense
by Tib.; a verb eti is not construable, and paramaṃ ti
(for iti), or paramam iti, would be much less probable
emendations.
