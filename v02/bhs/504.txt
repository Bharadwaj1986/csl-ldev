<L>504<pc>018,1<k1>अध्याहारिणीलिपि<k2>अध्याहारिणी-लिपि
{@adhyāhāriṇī-lipi@}¦, a kind of script: LV 126.9; so
read for Lefm. madhyā° (after -lipiṃ), allegedly with all
mss.; Calc. adhyā-, supported by Tib. bla ({%superior%}) thabs
su bsnan pa ({%? augmentation to a higher means?%}), which
suggests a form containing adhi; but I do not understand
the meaning of either the Tib. or the BHS form, unless
the latter means {%suppletive script%} (a term which might
conceivably have been applied e.g. to writing of conso-
nants alone, without vowels).
