{@aṅga, (1)@}¦ {%member, part%} (as in Skt. and Pali, where it is
recorded as nt. only), m. (at least modified by two m. adj.),
sarve bhavāṅga…niruddhāḥ LV 420.14 (so all mss.,
Lefm. °dhā); ({@2@}) {%attribute, quality, characteristic%}, like the
Skt. guṇa (so Pali, CPD s.v., 4, where it is shown that Pali
uses it ‘mostly with numbers’, and often in dependence on
samannāgata, cf. below); the 60 {%qualities%} (aṅga) of the
Buddha's voice, Mvy 444, listed 445--504, cf. Sūtrāl. xii.9;
same mg. in cpds., see {@aṣṭāṅga@} (2), {@āprāṇyāṅga, svarāṅ-@}
{@ga@}; also kulaṃ (the family in which the Bodhisattva is
born in his last existence) ṣaṣṭīhi aṅgehi samanvāgataṃ
bhavati Mv i.197.14 (there follows a list of the 60 ‘qualities’).
In the LV parallel, 23.10 ff., catuḥṣaṣṭy-ākārair…saṃ-
pannakulaṃ bhavati.Repetition Mv ii.1.6, also with list
following. Both Pali and BHS further refer to five {%bad%}
{%qualities%} as pañcāṅga (Pali °aṅga): pañcāṅga-viprahīṇa
(124.15 -vipratihīna), of Buddhas, Divy 95.17; 124.15;
264.30; acc. to Vism. 146.5--6 they are the nīvaraṇāni.
On the other hand, there are five {%good qualities%} referred to
by Pali pañcaṅga in Vism. 146.25 ff.; and a different set,
characteristic of kings or brahmans, {%‘gentlemanly qualities’%},
PTSD s.v.; cf. s.v. {@pañcāṅgika@}, esp. 3; the Buddha speaks
pañcāṅgena svareṇa, MSV i.220.20. The line between
meanings 1 and 2 is not always easy to draw. E.g. Mvy 424
describes the Tathāgata as ṣaḍaṅgasamanvāgataḥ, re-
ferring to the six aṅgas ({%‘qualities’?%} or {%members, parts?%}) of
{@upekṣā@}, cf. chaḷaṅgasamannāgata DN iii.269.19 (list
follows; consists of indifference to the objects of each of
six senses), and Vism. 160.9 ff. (chaḷaṅgupekkhā is the
first of ten upekkhā).
