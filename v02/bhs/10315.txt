<L>10315<pc>379,1<k1>प्रत्रेतु<k2>प्रत्रेतु-
[{@pratretu-@}¦ (kāma), LV 408.10 (prose), seems clearly
corrupt; it is parallel, and must be virtually synonymous,
with utpatitukāma; both are rendered in Tib. by ḥphur
(bar) ḥdod (pa), {%desirous of flying up%}, said of birds in a
cage, under which a fire is lighted. The vv.ll. are pratrentu-,
pratetu-, prakrāmatu-, and Calc. prakramitu-, the latter
clearly lect. fac. Prob. read praitu-k°, {%desirous of going%}
{%away%}.]
