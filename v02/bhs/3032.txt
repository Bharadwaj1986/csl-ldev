{@āvyūhati = āyūhati@}¦, {%exerts oneself towards, carries%}
{%out, performs%}, with acc.: MadhK 298.13; 517.20 sa na
kaṃcid dharmam āvyūhati nirvyūhati tasyaivam anā-
vyūhato 'nirvyūhatas traidhātuke cittaṃ na sajjati. Is
nirvyūhati a near-synonym of āvyūhati, as niryūhati
certainly is of āyūhati in Gv? Or is it (as assumed by Tib.
and La Vallée-Poussin) an antonym of āvyūhati, as
{@niryūhati@} is of {@āyūhati@} in Laṅk, and as (a)niryūha is
of (an)āyūha? See s.vv {@anāyūha, anāvyūha, anirvyūha@}.
