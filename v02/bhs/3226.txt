<L>3226<pc>117,1<k1>उकर<k2>उकर-
{@? ukara-@}¦ (v.l. udakara-, utkara-; cf. {@ugra-lipi@}), in
Mv i.135.6 (prose) ukara-madhura-darada-cīṇa- (etc.),
sc. lipi, a list of various kinds of writing. Senart would
em. ukaramadhura to uttara-kuru, very implausibly; the
parallel LV passage has {@ugra-lipi@} which surely represents
the same original as this word.
