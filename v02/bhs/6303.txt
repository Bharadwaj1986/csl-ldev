here of strips of flesh, Mv i.19.9 (prose); of either cloth or

{%strip%}) = Tib. (skra, {%hair%}) zur phud ({%hair-knot%}), Lalou,
Iconographie 66 f. (but I do not think, with Lalou, that
this or any cpd. ever refers to a {%diadem%}); Mañjuśrī's head
is adorned with five such, but some passages suggest that
in this he was like an ordinary youth in festive garb,

(the youth symbolizes Mañjuśrī, cf. 49.16 f.); Mañjuśrī is

to his head, pañcacīrakaśiraskaḥ 62.8; similarly 68.16;
75.14; ({@3@}) also in Mmk, cīraka-mudrā is a position of the
two hands, interlocked, in which one index finger is made
to project (muktvā) between the two thumbs, so that it
resembles a {%hair-braid%}: (anyonyasaktāṅgulimuṣṭayoḥ pra-

382.(15--)17; prob. this is alluded to by ekacīrakam (sc.
mudram; see s.v. {@mudra@}) 355.27, also sacred to Mañjuśrī;
its description in 382.15 ff. occurs in a list of mudrās the
names of which refer (presumably because of their shape)
to various parts of Mañjuśrī's body, e.g. tvadīyā vak-
tramudrā 382.11, etc. (note esp. 383.1 ff. śravaṇo grīvā
bhujau etc., without specific descriptions).
