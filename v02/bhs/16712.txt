({@sāṃparāyika@}¦, adj. (Skt.), {%of a future state%}; see prec.
and {@saṃpar°@}. The acc. nt. °kam is used as adv. SP 77.15,
with dṛṣṭadhārmikaṃ, and 482.3 dṛṣṭadhārmikaṃ (noun)
ca teṣāṃ sāṃparāyikaṃ (adv.) nivartiṣyati (or °tayiṣyati,
medio-passive!), {%and the worldly state will disappear for%}
{%them in the future world%}; misunderstood by Kern; Burnouf
is free but correct in essence. However, WT omit sāṃp°
with some mss. and Tib. Others, see {@saṃ°@} and {@dṛṣṭa-@}
{@dhārmika@}.)
