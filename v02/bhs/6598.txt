{@jāla, jālaka@}¦, nt., prob. {%bouquet of flowers%} (here
withered ones, to be removed from caityas); so jālaka is
used in Skt.; the only plausible alternative would be
{%spider-web%}, which jāla also means in Skt. (cf. Schmidt,
Nachträge) and Pali. In any case it means something
the {%removal%} of which from caityas is a work of merit:
yo jālakāni apanaye (so read with v.l. for Senart upanaye)
cetiyeṣu Mv ii.391.3; choretva jālaṃ jinacetiyeṣu 391.22,
repeated in the sequel; parallel Śikṣ 306.2, 4 choritva
jālaṃ; 6, 8, 10 apanīya (ed. em. upa°) jālaṃ. On the
passage, misunderstood by Senart and Bendall, see s.v.
{@chorayati@}. In the immediately following verses, Mv
ii.392.21 ff., Śikṣ 306.11 ff., the meritorious removal of
withered flowers is unambiguously mentioned.
