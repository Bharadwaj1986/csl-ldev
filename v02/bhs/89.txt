1 {@akhila@}¦ (opp. of, and perh. back-formation from,
1 {@sakhila@}, q.v.), {%ungentle%}, = paruṣa, of speech: Mv
i.202.7 = ii.6.4, read both times: akhilavacanāc ca narapati
viramāmi tathaiva paiśunyāt; same line i.145.10 has
paruṣa° for akhila°, and in the next line anṛtavacanāc ca,
which should be read in i.202.8 and ii.6.5 instead of
paruṣa° (which duplicates akhila°, and leaves ‘lying’ un-
mentioned).
