{@paritṛṣita@}¦, adj. (ppp. of next, q.v.; = Pali °tasita,
presumably subst., {%extreme craving%}, in DN i.40.2 taṇhāga-
tānaṃ paritasita-vipphanditam eva; see {@paritasana@}, and
{@°tarṣaṇa, °ṇā@}; Skt. has no form of pari plus tṛṣ-, but
the ppp. of tṛṣyati is Skt. tṛṣita; in Pali there seems to
be great confusion between forms of this root in -s-,
based chiefly on tṛṣita, leading even to a present tasati,
and in -ss-, based partly on tṛṣyati, partly on Skt. full-
grade forms in tarṣ-; in DN i.40.2, above, the v.l. °tassita
is recorded in text and comm.; both these are moreover
confused in Pali with the homonyms related to BHS
{@paritasyati, °tras(y)ati@}), {%eagerly desirous, longing%}, with
dat. or instr. or preceding stem in comp.: °tāḥ smo bha-
gavato darśanāya (ii.90.11 °nena) Av i.325.8; ii.90.11;
darśana-pari° Gv 223.17; 530.18; dharma-pari° Kv 80.13;
