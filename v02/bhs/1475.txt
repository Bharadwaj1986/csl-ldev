{@abhijānāti@}¦ (= Pali id.), ({@1@}) {%knows by%} {@abhijñā@}, q.v.
The technical Buddhist meaning of the noun is certainly
at times associated with the verb, which in Skt. means
{%knows%} in a very general way. The extent to which the spe-
cial Buddhist sense is present in the verb is often doubtful;
I list a few cases where it seems pretty clear: abhijānāmi
SP 200.8 (Burnouf and Kern, {%remember%}, I think wrongly);
Mv i.57.7, 12; Gv 446.14; Vaj 34.20. The translation
{%remember%}, also given CPD, is due to the fact that events
of the past are often referred to; but I think the Buddha
(the usual subject in such cases) {%knows%} them by {%super-%}
{%natural knowledge%} or so-called {%intuition%} ({@abhijñā@}, q.v.),
not by {%memory%}; ({@2@}) {%recognizes%} (as a duty), {%takes upon%}
{%oneself%} (a vow or undertaking); so also in Pali, e.g. MN
i.80.5 (definitions in Pali dictionaries including CPD
hardly do justice to this mg.): LV 254.2 abhijānāmy
ahaṃ…ekam evādvitīyaṃ kolam āhāram āhartum, {%I%}
{%undertake to allow myself to eat only a single kola as food%};
similarly LV 255.8, 15.
