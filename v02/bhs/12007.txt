{@Māra@}¦, m. (= Pali id.), {%the Evil One, the adversary%}
{%and tempter%}; regularly with ep. pāpīyāṃs; often styled
{@Namuci@}, q.v.; sometimes {%the great%} {@yakṣa@}, q.v.: in the
singular, so usually, as the One who tries to thwart the
Bodhisattva or Buddha and his followers, SP 63.6; 64.2;
145.2, 3; LV 260.17 ff.; 267.2; 299.20 ff. (long chapter
on his temptations of and attacks on Śākyamuni); Divy
144.14; 145.4; 201.22 ff.; 202.2 ff. (here, as often, tempts
Buddha to enter nirvāṇa); Jm 19.20 ff.; an unspecific
plurality of Māras, SP 64.3; Śikṣ 49.7 f. mārāḥ pāpīyāṃso
bodhisattvasya viheṭhanām (so with ms.) upasaṃharanti;
in Gv 444.12 there is a Māra named {@Suvarṇaprabha@}
who tries to interfere with a Bodhisattva named Vimala-
prabha in his quest of enlightenment; Māra is converted(!)
by Upagupta, Divy 357.1 ff.; there are ten Māra-karmāṇi,
{%deeds of Satan%}, of which an erring Bodhisattva may be
guilty, Śikṣ 151.13--152.19 (listed in detail); plurality of
Māras, in Pali 3, 4, or 6 (in the latter case including Abhi-
saṃkhāra-māra, which has not been noted in BHS, cf.
{@abhisaṃskāra@}), whereas in BHS they are standardly
four, viz. (the order varies) Kleśa-māra, Skandha-māra,
Mṛtyu-māra, and Devaputra-māra (the last means the
anthropomorphic Evil One; excellent brief statements on
the others, which mean in effect quasi-personifications of
kleśa etc., in Childers s.v. Māro); to these corresp. Pali
Kilesa-, Khandha-, Maccu-, and Devaputta-māra (but in
Pali, even when the Māras number four, it need not be
{%these%} four); only two named SP 290.9 (śrāvakāṃś) ca
bodhisattvāṃś ca skandhamāreṇa vā kleśamāreṇa vā
sārdhaṃ yudhyamānān…, in next line (10) sarva-māra-
nirghātanaṃ; similarly in Mv iii.273.2 only two, Kleśa-
māro bhagno; Devaputramāro bhagno; but usually all
four are named, so Mv iii.281.7 f.; Dharmas 80; Śikṣ
198.10 f.; Sādh 20.1--2; exigences of meter may cause
abbreviations, as in LV 224.18--19 where all mss. and
Calc. have all four names in full, but meter requires Deva-
māra instead of Devaputra°; so LV 354.11--12 (vss) anena
jitu Skandhamāras tatha Mṛtyu-Kleśa-māraḥ (v.l. Mṛtyu-
māra-Kleśamārāḥ, bad meter), anena jitu Devaputra-
māras; four Māras referred to but not listed Dbh.g.
55(81).3, 14; Gv 472.15.
