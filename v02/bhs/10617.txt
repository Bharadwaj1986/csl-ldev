{@? prasena@}¦, nt. (in Skt., acc. to pw, {%eine Art Gaukelei%},
which seems certainly not what our word means), acc.
to Tib. gsal snaṅ, {%bright light%}, or {%bright clear%}: °nam Mvy
4268; Chin. also {%clear bright%}. Follows pratyālīḍham and
precedes siddhiḥ; lack of context leaves mg. very obscure.
