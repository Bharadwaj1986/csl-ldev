{@Yaśodeva, (1)@}¦ n. of a disciple of Buddha: LV 1.8
(no v.l.). Evidently corresponds to Pali Yasa (Thera, 1
in DPPN; cf. {@Yaśas@} 1, {@Yaśoda@}), of Vin. i.15.1 ff., as is
shown by the next four names in LV, Vimala, Subāhu,
Pūrṇa, and Gavāṃpati, who correspond to the four friends
of Yasa named in Vin. i.18.36 f., Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji,
and Gavampati. So also Sukh 2.3, followed by Vimala,
Subāhu, and Pūrṇa (Maitrāyaṇīputra). ({@2@}) n. of an upāsaka
or lay-disciple, surely not the same as 1: Gv 51.10.
