{@upadhi@}¦ (m.; = Pali upadhi, and also Pali upādi),
({@1@}) {%substratum%} of continued existence; {%attachment, bond%}
uniting one to existence. Acc. to Childers upādi means
the khandhas alone, while upadhi includes also kilesa
(with which PTSD makes it ‘almost synonymous’), kāma,
and kamma; but acc. to PTSD upadhi is sometimes equated
with the pañca-kkhandhā. In Pali, upādi is, acc. to PTSD,
used only in comp. with -sesa, in cpds. usually beginning
sa- or an- and regularly epithets of nibbāna (-dhātu);
these are represented in BHS by {@anupadhiśeṣa, nirupa°,@}
{@sopa°@}, qq.v. But BHS also has upadhi and {@nir-up°@} (m.c.
{@niropadhi@}) = Pali (nir-) upadhi.The passages here listed
belong exclusively to this latter class, = Pali upadhi.
(But it seems that even in Pali, upadhi and upādi are not
always clearly distinguished.) upadhī-kṣīṇā LV 358.18

In Mvy 6499 upadhi has three Tib. definitions; the first,
phuṅ po, regularly = {@skandha@} (as Pali upādi = khandha);
the third, ñon moṅs pa, regularly = {@kleśa@} (as Pali upadhi,
‘almost syn. with kilesa,’ PTSD); while the second, rdzas,
{%thing, substance, matter%}, belongs to a meaning of the word
app. unknown to Pali, viz. ({@2@}) {%material thing, ‘chose maté-%}
{%rielle’%} (Lévi, = Tib. dṅos, which also = Skt. vastu), Sūtrāl.
