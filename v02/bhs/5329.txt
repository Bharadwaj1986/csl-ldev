{@? krauṣita(-śabda)@}¦, (sound of) {%shrieking%}: Gv 522.16
(prose) °daṃ ca nārakāṇāṃ śṛṇyāt. Evidently a false
hyper-Skt. form, based on some MIndic derivative of root
kruś; no recorded form suggests itself as the precise source.
Textual corruption, beyond the obvious ṣ for ś, is probably
concerned.
