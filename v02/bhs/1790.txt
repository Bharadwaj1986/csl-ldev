{@Amarā, (1)@}¦ n. of a smith's daughter (= later Yaśo-
dharā), who married Mahauṣadha; heroine of a Jātaka
which = the Pali Sūci-j., No. 387: Mv ii.83.19 ff.; colo-
phon 89.11 Amarāye karmāradhītāye jātakam. In the
Sūci-j. the characters are unnamed; but (Pali) Mahosadha
[Page063-a+ 71]
is the hero of the Mahāummagga-j., No. 546, and Amarā
is his wife. This has misled both CPD and DPPN into
identifying {%this%} Pali Jātaka with the story of Mv. Actually
the stories are quite different, and Mv agrees with the
Sūci-j., which, to be sure, acc. to the Story of the Present,
belongs to the same occasion as the Mahāummagga;
hence doubtless the transfer of the names of the hero
and heroine from one to the other. Which was the original?
({@2@}) n. of a river: Māy 253.6; in a list between Viśvāmitrā
and Tāmarā; not in Kirfel; perhaps read Amalā? (but
this also is not recorded as a river-name).
