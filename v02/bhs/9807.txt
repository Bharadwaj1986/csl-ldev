{@poṣa@}¦, m. (= Pali posa, which is said by PTSD and
Geiger 30.3 to be used only in vss; doubtless somehow
derived from Skt. puruṣa, but Geiger's theory is not
compelling), {%person, individuality, soul, spirit%}; occurs often
in prose of various texts, regularly associated with near-
synonyms like jīva, jantu, pudgala (puṃgala), and even
with puruṣa itself, which clearly had come to be felt as
a different word (if it was derived from the same original):
in Mvy 4672 defined by Tib. gso ba, {%nourishment%}, as if
from root puṣ-, tho the context proves it means the same
as puruṣa, which is the next word; puruṣa also adjoins
it (along with other words of like mg.) in Śikṣ 236.15;
Laṅk 63.15, et alibi; ŚsP 120.12 (puruṣa in parallel phrase
13), et alibi; otherwise with similar words, Śikṣ 199.8;
KP 125.6; 142.8 (in these two miswritten pauṣa); Dbh
39.21; MSV ii.76.15; {@niṣpoṣa@}, {%without personality%}, along
with nirjīva, niṣpudgala, etc., KP 97.2; Dbh 43.13; Vaj
38.5.
