{@keśoṇḍuka@}¦, m. and nt. (recorded once, erroneously,
as °ṇḍraka, in Skt., pw, defined as {%ringförmige Licht-%}
{%erscheinungen vor geschlossenen Augen%}), also {@°ḍu@}, and v.l.
{@°ḍaka@}, apparently primarily {%hair-net%} or the like; this lit.
mg. apparently in Bcṭ 245.3 °ka-maṇḍitam; standardly
used as a symbol of unreality, prob. with mg. as cited
from pw above: °ḍukaḥ (so also Mironov; v.l. in both
°ḍakaṃ) Mvy 2836, among synonyms for māyā; frequent
in Laṅk, e.g. 168.5 (cited MadhK 262.2) keśoṇḍukaṃ
yathā mithyā gṛhyate taimirair (MadhK °rikair, unmetr.)
janaiḥ (vs); 96.5 skandhāḥ keśoṇḍukākārāḥ; 17.6 °ka-
svabhāvāvasthitānām; 72.6 and 82.1 °ka-prakhyā(ḥ), etc.
Suzuki regularly renders {%hair-net%}, but this in its literal
sense does not fit.
