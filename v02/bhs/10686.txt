{@prātihāraka-pakṣa@}¦, m. (only once, Mmk 79.19, is
pakṣa not expressed), more rarely {@prati°, prātihāra-,@}
{@°hārika-@} (= Pali pāṭihārika-pakkha or pāṭihāriya-p°,
inaccurately defined PTSD; the mg. is evidently related
to that of {@prātihārya@}, q.v., but {%quinzaine du miracle%},
Lalou, Iconographie 24, is hardly likely to be the true mg.,
tho it is the lit. mg. of the Tib. cited, cho phrul gyi…),
{%extraordinary, exceptional half-month%}. The Pali comms. vary
greatly in their explanations; see citations in PTSD; note
specially AN comm. ii.234.25 ff. on AN i.144.2 (cited
PTSD °hārika-, but actually °hāriya-) in contrast with
Vv. comm. 71.26 ff. on Vv. 15 vs 6 (same stanza as in AN,
wholly discordant glosses in comms.; at least one of them
clearly a baseless guess). Evidently the tradition of the
true mg. was lost at an early time. In BHS noted only
in Mmk, where it is fairly common, but I have found no
evidence as to mg., except that pakṣa has its usual mg.
{%half-lunar-month%} (not {%holiday%} with PTSD); this is proved
by prātihāraka-pakṣa-pūrṇamāsyāṃ Mmk 669.19-20, {%on%}
{%the full-moon day of…%} Otherwise, usually °raka-pakṣe

Mmk 58.11; 75.10; 289.19; 669.22--23 (°rakapakṣe pūrṇa-
māsyāṃ); 675.28; 676.28; 715.6, et alibi; śuklapūrṇamā-

{%day of a bright fortnight, when%} (the moon) {%is full in a%}
{%prātihāraka%} (sc. pakṣa; the only case noted in which this
is omitted); prātihārika-pakṣe 290.1; śuklapakṣe prātihāra-
pakṣe vā 145.21 (prose; is the omission of -ka a mere
corruption?), {%in a bright fortnight, or in a prāti° one%};
pratihāraka-pakṣe 36.25; 675.7 (foll. by śuklatrayodaśyāṃ;
evidently the ‘extraordinary’ fortnight could be either
‘light’ or ‘dark’); pratihāraka-pakṣam ārabhya 675.22
(passages with prati° all prose).
