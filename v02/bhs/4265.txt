<L>4265<pc>160,2<k1>ओस्वापन<k2>ओस्वापन
{@osvāpana@}¦, nt. (presumably for {@ava-sv°@}, to {@ava-@}
{@svāpayati@} with -ana; cf. {@apa-sv°@}), {%going to sleep; sleeping%};
or perhaps {%putting to sleep%}: LV 236.8 (vs; avasvāpanaṃ
would be metrically better!) devatābhi osvāpanaṃ kṛtam
(in the corresponding prose version 217.7 apasvāpanaṃ);
Mv iii.296.16 (prose) sarvasya rājakulasya °naṃ kṛtam.
Non-causative mg. would be possible in both cases, tho
causative mg. would seem more natural; but see under
{@apasvāpana@}; see also {@osopati, °pana@}.
