{@rājanya@}¦, adj. (seems not recorded elsewhere in this
sense), {%belonging to a king, royal%}: of a park, udyāna, Mv
ii.112.9, 11; Senart em. {@rājakya@}, q.v.; but he keeps
rājanyaṃ ii.452.1 (of an āmravanaṃ) and °nyāni kaṇṭhe-
guṇāni (so mss.) 463.3. In the vicinity of all these passages
{@rājakya@} occurs; possibly it should always be read (with
Senart on 112.9, 11).
