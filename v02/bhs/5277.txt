{@kaumodī@}¦ (= Skt. kaumudī), {%festival of the full-moon%}
{%day%}: LV 72.19 (prose), °dyām iva cāturmāsyām; all mss.
°mod°, perhaps by analogy of relatives of root mud (moda,
etc.); or cf. Skt. kaumodakī (?). The phrase kaumudī
cāturmāsī occurs twice in Mv, but no form of this word
with medial o for u is otherwise recorded.
