{@adhitiṣṭhati@}¦, also {@adhiṣṭhahati, °ṣṭhihati@} (and noun
{@adhiṣṭhāna@}, q.v.; Pali adhitiṭṭhati, adhiṭṭhāna, in general
in same meanings; previous translations of BHS vary
widely and are hardly worth systematic quotation; very
common is {%bless%}, which I think should be deleted, see
below): ({@1@}) {%masters, controls%}, in normal Skt. (BR sthā
with adhi 3, 4) and also BHS (exx. La Vallée Poussin,
AbhidhK. vii.119 note 2, b); in BHS particularly {%takes%}
{%possession%} or {%control of%}, MSV i.248.20 (sāptāhikaṃ), and
ff.; Bhīk 15 a. 1 (the newly initiated nun says to her in-
structress) samanvāhara upādhyāyike, aham…idaṃ cī-
varaṃ saṃghāṭīm adhitiṣṭhāmi, {%I take%} (formal) {%possession%}
{%of my nun's garments%} (similarly with other implements,
below: Ridding p. 124 calls this rite {%benediction%} of the
garments, etc.; but the nun is the only speaker; she
would not ‘bless’ her own belongings!); in BHS ({@2@}) the
power or control is usually {%supernatural%} or {%magical%}:
adhitiṣṭhantu buddhā bhagavanto idaṃ paṭasūtram Mmk
56.12, {%let the Lord Buddhas exercize their supernatural%}
{%power over%} (assume control of) {%this thread%} (Lalou, Icono-
graphie p 20, {%occupent%}); in the sequel, favorable sounds
show the performer that, adhiṣṭhitaṃ me buddhair…
tat paṭasūtraṃ (17); he reflects, buddhānāṃ…adhiṣṭhā-
nam etat (24), {%this is the controlling power of the B%}.; Laṅk
[Page013-a+ 71]
100.6 ff., Bodhisattvas may be adhiṣṭhānadvayādhiṣṭhitāḥ,
{%controlled by two supernatural powers%} (of Buddhas, cf. 11
buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitāḥ); these are (9) samādhisamā-
pattyadhiṣṭhāna; {%the control that gives attainment of samā-%}
{%dhis%} (cf. 12 samādhiṃ samāpadyante; to this verb {@samā-@}
{@patti@}, q.v., is merely a noun of action; wrongly Suzuki),
and sarvakāyamukhapāṇyabhiṣekādhiṣṭhāna, {%the control%}
{%that comes from sprinkling by%} (the Buddha's) {%hands of the%}
{%whole body and face%} (cf. 101.10--11); persons are said to
be adhiṣṭhita, {%supernaturally controlled%} by Buddhas (may
often be rendered {%inspired%}) SP 231.1; 238.2; 420.4; LV
275.2; Laṅk 4.13; cf. {@adhiṣṭhāna@}; this {%control%} often in-
volves ({@3@}) {%magic transformation%}, and even the {%creation of%}
{%magic appearances%}; not easily separated from the preced-
ing; transitional is sarvabuddhādhiṣṭhito 'yaṃ…dharma-
paryāyaḥ SP 288.13, {%it is under the supernatural control%}
{%of all the Buddhas%} (hence marvelous effects for one who
preaches it, as related above), with this cf. tasmāt tarhi
…adhitiṣṭhāmīmaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ asmiñ jambudvīpe
SP 421.2, {%therefore I%} (lit. {%exercize supernatural power over%}
{%this Dh%}., which however here seems to mean) {%make this%}
{%Dh. appear in this J%}. (with magical effects, some mentioned
above, some in the next sentence); from such passages
as this and SP 384.3, below, La Vallée Poussin, AbhidhK.,
Index, and esp. vii.119, note 2, derives the supposed
meaning {%faire durer%}, but in iii.31, note 2, quoting the
vyākhyā, he translates adhitiṣṭhati {%bénit%}, whereas it means
{%takes under control, assumes control of%}; the meaning {%bless%},
assumed by Burnouf and many others, rests on Tib. byin
kyi rlabs, which to be sure often means {%bless%}, but acc. to
Jäschke also {%create, change into%}; this kind of change by
magical mastery or control need not be a {%blessing%}, cf.
(tā jarājarjarā) adhyatiṣṭhat LV 378.17, {%he changed them%}
(the daughters of Māra, by magic control) {%so as to be%}
{%decrepit with age%}, and later, buddhasya yo hy adhiṣṭhānaṃ
śaknuyāt kartum anyathā 379.3, (I see no one) {%who could%}
{%alter a magic transformation of the Buddha%}; mahābrahmā
imaṃ…lokadhātuṃ tat kṣaṇaṃ samam adhyatiṣṭhat,
pāṇitalajātam…tṛṇair imaṃ…lokadhātuṃ saṃchādi-
tam adhyatiṣṭhat LV 276.19 ff., {%the Great Brahmā magically%}
{%mastered%} (and thereby changed) {%this entire world%} (so as to
be) {%even%}, etc.,…{%covered with grass%}; in SP 384.3 (as he
was about to die, Sadāparibhūta heard this sūtra; then,
not dying after all,) adhiṣṭhihitvā ca sudīrgham āyuḥ,
{%and having mastered, acquired, assumed by magic, very long%}
{%life%} (he proceeded to proclaim this sūtra; similar passages
are taken by La Vallée Poussin l.c. to mean {%faire durer%});

skārān utsraṣṭum ārabdhaḥ. samanantarādhiṣṭhiteṣu jīvita-
saṃskāreṣu (omens occurred) Divy 203.7--8 (in this phrase
LaV-P, AbhidhK. ii.122. renders {%stabilisé%}; note the term
vaśitva in the comm., l.c. 124 line 1; render {%controlling%}),
see {@saṃskāra@} 2; buddhā bhagavantaḥ taṃ pṛthivī-
pradeśaṃ vajramayam adhitiṣṭhanti sma LV 86.16--17,
…{%magically made this spot of ground%} (where the young
Bodhisattva took seven steps) {%hard as a diamond%}, so that
it did not sink under his feet (N.B. they did not literally
{%stand upon%} it; they were located sthitāḥ line 16, in the
ten quarters); tatrāpi cātmānam adhiṣṭhahāmi, sarvāṃś
ca sattvān ah[am] adhiṣṭhihāmi (so read, § 8.99) SP 323.13,
{%there%} (having made it appear that I entered nirvāṇa, tho
I did not) {%I make myself appear%} (create myself magically,
cf. 316.1, s.v. adhiṣṭhāna 3), {%and I control all creatures%}
(in next line, {%men of perverted minds were deluded and did%}
{%not see me, tho I was standing right there%}); with SP 384.3
cf. Dbh 91.28 sarvasattvāṃś ca ākāṅkṣan yathābhiprāyaṃ
rūpāśrayālaṃkṛtān adhitiṣṭhati; in this section adhitiṣṭhati
occurs many times, beginning with 90.21--22 saṃkṣiptāyā
lokadhātor vistīrṇatām adhitiṣṭhati, and means always
(a Bodhisattva in the tenth stage) {%makes appear magically%},
either by transformation or creation; cf. in Pali Therag.

(by his supernatural power, but this time without the
usual connotation of magic or illusion); catvāri pātrāṇi
pratigṛhyaikaṃ pātram adhitiṣṭheyam LV 384.4--5,
{%accepting the four bowls I will change them magically into%}
{%a single bowl%}, which he does; pratigṛhya caikaṃ pātram
adhitiṣṭhati sma, adhimuktibalena 385.4 (see {@adhimukti@} 2
which in such passages = adhiṣṭhāna).
