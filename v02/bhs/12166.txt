{@musāra, musāgalva@}¦ (often in Mv, nowhere else),
{@musāragalva@} (the regular BHS form), {@musāragalvārka,@}
{@musālagalva@} (?), sometimes miswritten {@susāra(galva,@}
{@°galvārka)@} in mss. and even in edd. (Divy 67.18, Mmk
120.22), m. (rarely nt.), a kind of precious stone. Recorded
once in Skt., musāragalva, said to mean a kind of {%coral%}
(pw); otherwise forms with mu- only noted in BHS; but
cf. Skt. masāra and masāragalvarka (rarely written
°vārka), said to mean {%sapphire%} or {%emerald%}; Pali masāra-
galla, usually said to mean {%cat's eye%}, but Burnouf found
a Pali Lex. source identifying it with pavāla, {%coral%} (Lotus
319 f.) and hence adopted this mg. for BHS, followed
by Senart Mv i.415, and doubtfully by Kern SBE 21.147
n. 2; AMg. masāra and °ra-galla, said to mean {%sapphire%};
in recent years most interpreters of BHS have left the
exact mg. undetermined; it usually occurs in rigmarole
lists of various gems (once, at least, pravāla, {%coral%}, occurs
earlier in the same list, Mv ii.472.1--2); Tib. on Mvy 5956
spug, a gem which Jä. leaves unidentified, while Das
gives as Skt. equivalent (kakkatana and) karketana, said
to mean {%cat's-eye%} (cf. Pali above); clearly masc. gender
when unambiguous, as a rule, e.g. Mvy 5956; Divy 51.25,
etc., but musāraṃ, n. sg., Mmk 120.22; besides this last,
stem musāra Mv iii.323.13 in one ms. (v.l. musāgalva;
Senart musāragalva); vaiḍūrya-musāra-pratyuptāṃ Laṅk
3.5; musālagalva (rare) Mvy 5956 (but Mironov musāra°,
no v.l.); Mv iii.304.12 (so, or musā-g°, mss., Senart em.
musāra°); musāgalva in text, no v.l., Mv i.194.9, 10;
196.17; 249.6; iii.227.7; 228.2, 14; 229.13; 323.16; 324.6;
read musā-g°, with most mss. or requirements of meter,
i.49.11; 63.2; ii.186.13; text musāra° but mss. divided
evenly with v.l. musā°, i.49.14; ii.177.17; 180.14; 191.5;
310.8; 316.8; 472.2; iii.226.11; 232.10; musāragalvārka
(cf. Skt. above) Divy 67.18 (ed. susā°); 138.3; the regular
form in all texts is, however, musāragalva, Divy 51.25;
115.3; 229.7; 297.25; 502.7; Av i.205.3; Gv 52.15; 89.25;
148.13; Dbh 46.19; Bbh 5.10; 234.1; SP 151.2; 153.4;
239.7; 256.12; LV 383.2, etc.
