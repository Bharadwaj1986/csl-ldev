1 {@nāma = avanāma@}¦, q.v., {%depression%} (of spirits),
only in Śikṣ 108.12, see s.v. {@unnāma@}. In this verse ava-
nāma or onāma would be unmetrical; but it is barely
possible that the text unnāmanāmāni should be taken for
unnāma-(o)nāmāni, with MIndic elision in saṃdhi of
initial o (for ava) after final a in comp.
