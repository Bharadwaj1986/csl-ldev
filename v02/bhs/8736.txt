{@pakva-taila@}¦ (cf. Pali telaṃ pakkaṃ, Dhp. comm.
i.12.8, {%oil has been prepared%}, lit. {%cooked%}, sc. to be used as
ointment), {%prepared oil%} (ointment?): te dāni °lena bhaga-
vantaṃ nimantrayetsuḥ Mv iii.329.14. The corresp. Pali
cpd. seems to be pāka-tela; e.g. Dhp. comm. iii.311.8--9
sata-pāka-telena, {%with oil a hundred times refined%} (Bur-
lingame, HOS 30.105). Is -āk- here for -akk- by the
Morengesetz ? The form to be expected is Pali pakka =
pakva.
