{@adhyācāra@}¦, m. (to prec.; = Pali ajjhācāra, regularly
in bad and ‘especially in an erotical sense’, CPD), {%per-%}
{%formance, commission%} (of evil, sin), (sinful) {%behavior%} (with
gen. of the sin, or in comp.): punar anadhyācārāya Bbh
181.12, {%so as not to sin again%}; sāvadyasya ca dānādikasya
kuśalasyādhyācāraḥ 289.11; āpatty-anadhyācāra-289.22;
anadhyācāre adhyācāravairamaṇyāṃ tīvraś…yogaḥ
karaṇīyaḥ Bhīk 27b.4, {%serious discipline in not sinning,%}
{%ceasing from sin, must be undertaken%}; for this, which seems
the correct reading, Bhīk 24b.5; 28a.1, 4; 28b.2 (by
error?) °anadhyācāravairamaṇyāṃ°; but also in MSV
iii.8.10 anadhyācāram ācarate, {%engages in sinful behavior%},
implies adhyācāra = {%good behavior%}; Tib. also has a neg.,
spyad par bya ba ma yin pa spyod pa; but the text is
pretty surely wrong, since in 9.10 the opposite is na adhyā-
cāram ācarate, {%engages in no sinful behavior%}.
