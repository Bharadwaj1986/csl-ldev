2 {@parītta@}¦ (nt.; = Pali 2 paritta, see PTSD, or °ttā),
{%protection, safeguard, refuge%} (from Skt. pari-trā-): suparīt-
taṃ (v.l. °ītaṃ) bhāvayiṣyati Mv ii.145.8, {%he%} (the Bodhi-
sattva) {%will produce, effect, a good safeguard%} (refuge, against
the ills of life); otherwise, but very implausibly, Senart.
The ī may be due to influence of the very common homo-
nym, 1 {@parītta@}; but, of course, the ī of the preverb pari-
is otherwise capable of lengthening in Skt.
