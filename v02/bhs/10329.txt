{@pradadhāti@}¦ (= Pali padahati, with cittaṃ, DN
iii.221.14), {%exerts%} (the mind, cittaṃ): evaṃ cittaṃ prada-
dhyās tvaṃ Śikṣ 101.10 (vs, from Samādh). From this
verb, as used in Pali, are derived {@pradhāna@} and {@prahāṇa@}
(1), also {@prahita@}, qq.v.; and in Mv ii.208.1 (prahāṇaṃ)
pradadhāti, {%exerts himself in exertion%}, should prob. be read
(for corrupt mss.) instead of Senart's em. pratidadhāti; cf.
both pradhāna and prahāṇa dependent on prahita, q.v.
[In pw s.v. dhā with pra cited from LV Calc. as mg. {%sich%}
{%einer Sache%} (acc.) {%hingeben%}, but Lefm. 385.12 (vs) reads
with some mss. pradadhyau (to dhyā), which is proved
right by meter and Tib. dgoṅs.]
