{@adhikāra@}¦, m., (= Pali id.), {%service, respectful duty%}
{%performed towards another%}, usually a superior (and esp. a
Buddha); Senart Mv i.402, note on i.37.11--12, renders
{%offrande%}, and so Suzuki on Laṅk 6.3 {%offerings%}. No doubt
the ‘service’ often included or consisted of offerings; but
that this was not necessarily so is proved by SP 111.12
bahūhi kāryehi kṛtādhikārāḥ, said of merchants (vāṇijāḥ)
employed by a wealthy capitalist who {%do service%} (to him)
{%with many business-operations%} (certainly not {%offerings%},
kāryehi!). The cpd. {@kṛtādhikāra@} (Pali katā°) is very
common and in BHS most often refers to {%services%} per-
formed for present or past Buddhas: SP 49.13; Laṅk 6.3
(kṛtādhikārā buddheṣu kariṣyanty adhunā ca vai); Mv
ii.288.8; iii.263.12; purima-jina-kṛtādhikāra LV 393.6;
Mv ii.312.5; sumahantā adhikārā mayā kṛtā (to former
Buddhas) Mv iii.241.12; (bhagavato…) adhikāraṃ
kartuṃ Mv i.37.12;…kṛtvā Mv i.44.14; prasannādhikāra,
{%service tendered by one who is kindly disposed%}, i.e. {%service%}
{%of friendship%}, Divy 305.7; 308.20 ff.
