<L>10560<pc>387,2<k1>प्रशठ<k2>प्रशठ, °ठा, °ठता
{@? praśaṭha, °ṭhā, °ṭhatā@}¦, uncertain; in KP 154.1
(prose) samyakprahāṇa-(see {@prahāṇa@})-prasaṭhā (so divide)
ri-(lacuna; Tib. rdzu ḥphrul = ṛddhi-); Tib. renders
prasaṭhā by ḥgro ba, here doubtless {%entrance into…%}; the
syllable ṭhā seems corrupt but I think of no attractive em.
Dubious also is praśaṭhatā Mvy 2101 (both edd., no v.l.),
which looks as if it meant {%trickery, deceitfulness%} (so pw
7.362; cf. AMg. pasaḍha, {%rogue, trickster%}); but Tib. renders
rnal du ({%into tranquillity%}) (ḥ)bab ({%entrance into%}) or ḥdug
pa ({%state of%}), which suggests a form of śam (cf. {@śamatha@});
Chin. acc. to Ting, {%elimination of differences among things%},
resulting in tranquillity (the last phrase not in Chin. here
but cited from a parallel passage).
