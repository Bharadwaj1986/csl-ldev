{@anuvartanā@}¦ (Skt. °na, nt., Pali °vattana, nt.; see
also {@°vartanatā@}), {%conformity to, imitation of%}, with gen. or
in comp.: (dharmāṇām) Bbh 107.24; 108.2; lokānu°, said
of the Buddha, LV 238.3 °nām upādāya; 392.8 °nāṃ (so
with best mss., edd. °tināṃ) praty; 119.7 °na (m.c. for
°nāṃ) pratī (m.c. for prati); acc. to the Lokottaravādin
school, this {%conformity to worldly life%} on the part of the
Buddha is a mere ‘imitation’ or ‘reflection’, as in a mirror,
bimbe kanakabimbābhe eṣā °tanā Mv i.168.15; this passage
is a locus classicus for this doctrine; in 168.8--9 lokānuvar-
tanāṃ buddhā anuvartanti laukikīṃ, prajñaptim anu-
vartanti yathā lokottarām api; in what follows, Buddhas
are said to imitate worldly actions (the care of the body,
etc.), tho they have no need to, since everything about
them is lokottara, {%transcending the world%}.
