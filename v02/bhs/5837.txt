{@go-kaṇṭaka@}¦ (Skt. Lex., of ground, roads; cf. Pali
gokaṇṭaka-hata, of ground, bhūmi; alleged in Skt. Lex.
also to mean {%the hoofs of cattle%}), lit. apparently {%having%}
{%cattle as ‘thorns’ = enemies, afflictions; trampled by cattle%},
of grain: Divy 19.19 kharā bhūmī, gokaṇṭakā dhānā (so
mss., ed. em. dhānāḥ). The Pali cpd. could be rendered
consistently with this: {%afflicted because of being trampled%}
{%by cattle%}. This seems to be substantially what is meant by
AN comm. ii.225.11--15.
