{@a-kisara-lābhin@}¦, adj., and {@°bhi-tā@}, abstr.; also in
Skt. form as {@a-kṛcchra°@}, {%(state of) obtaining without%}
{%difficulty%}: akṛcchra-lābhī (n. sg.) Mvy 2432 = dkaḥ pa
med par thob pa, and akisara-l° 2433 = tshegs med par°,
or, ṅan ṅon ma yin par°; akṛcchrākisaralābhi-tā Bbh
388.13 = (acc. to note) Tib. ṅan ṅon ma yin par thob pa
daṅ tshegs med par thob pa. The three Tib. translations
are synonymous; it is striking that both the MIndic and
the Sktized forms are recorded together in both Mvy and
Bbh. Pali has both akasiralābhi(n) and akiccha°; other-
wise the cpd. is not recorded. Even akṛcchra is not recorded
in Skt. except for akṛcchra-laṅghya in pw 5.240 (from
Rājat.; perhaps due to Buddhist influence?). See {@kisara@};
it appears that in Pali, too, kasira and kiccha, both histori-
cally from kṛcchra, came to be understood as different
words. This suggests that BHS a-kṛcchra-lābhin may be a
Sktization of an older MIndic a-kiccha° (= Pali and Pkt.
id.), specifically, and not of BHS {@kisara@}, which maintained
an independent existence for a time, tho ultimately it was
crowded out by the Sktized kṛcchra.
