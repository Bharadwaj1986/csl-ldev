{@? Draupadī@}¦, n. of a devakumārikā (or of two? see
below) in the Western Quarter: Mv iii.308.9; LV 390.6.
Mss. of both confused, and readings doubtful; Senart
reads kṛṣṇā śukrā ca dr°, {%the dark and light Dr%}.; LV may
go back to some such reading; some of its mss. and Lefm.'s.
text contain kṛṣṇā. It hardly needs to be recalled that
Kṛṣṇā was the name of the epic heroine known as Draupadī.
