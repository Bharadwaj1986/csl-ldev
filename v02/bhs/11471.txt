{@maṇḍalaka, (1)@}¦ m. (adj.?), a kind of {%disease which%}

nected or not connected with that which stands on it),
{%base%} for something: trapu-°kam Mvy 8954 (both Tib.

read sbyar), with or without ḥdab (= ḥdabs, {%surface%}),
which could mean {%(surface) attachment of lead%} (?); follows
{@cakoraka@}, q.v.; the Tib. (contrary to Chin.) could ap-

modern edd. by māṇḍalika-, which is Skt.; see s.v. {@maṇ-@}
