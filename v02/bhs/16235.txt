{@saṃpratigraha@}¦ (m.? = Pali saṃpaṭiggaha, in
Khud.p. comm. 100.2 vacana-saṃ°, {%acceptance of some-%}
{%thing said%}; wrongly defined PTSD), {%acceptance%}: vrati-
saṃpratigrahāpadeśena Jm 37.24, {%under pretext of accept-%}
{%ance%} (of the proffered boon) {%on the part of one%} (viz. himself)
{%who had undertaken a vow%}. (Speyer, Transl. 52 n. 2, follows
Kern in emending vrati to vṛti, {%boon%}, = vara; but vṛti
is known only in Skt. Lex. and seems unlikely to have
been used in this prose passage; I see no difficulty in
[Page577-b+ 71]
vrati-; pw 7.381 {%gute Aufnahme, Vorliebe für Jmd%}, not
happily.) Cf. next.
