({@vāyu-maṇḍala-vat@}¦, adv., = Skt., Mbh. 12.6886,
{%like a whirlwind%}: °vad ākāśe paribhramanti Av i.256.9
{%rush around in the sky like a whirlwind%}; Chin. acc. to Speyer
{%moving rapidly to the four points of the compass%}; from this
Speyer infers that vāyumaṇḍala was taken as {%the circuit%}
{%of the compass%}; but Chin. evidently rendered ākāśe by
that phrase, and vāyumaṇḍalavat, loosely, by {%rapidly%}.
Cf. {@vātamaṇḍalī@}.)
