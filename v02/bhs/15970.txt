{@samanvī@}¦, in Gv 254.11 (vs), app. a semi-MIndic
contracted form for samanvitaḥ, {%provided%}: dvātriṃśalak-
ṣaṇa-°vī so 'nuvyañjanai (read anu°?) racitagātraḥ; the
meter is perfect in the first pāda, and may be partly
responsible for this form, which I derive from a con-
traction of a MIndic form resembling AMg. samaṇṇia
(with Skt. nv restored); see § 3.118.
