{@aniṣṭhā-pada@}¦, apparently intended at Laṅk 180.17
(text anadhiṣṭhāpada) and 227.4 (text aṣṭāpada); Tib.
thug pa med paḥi gnas. Suzuki transl. {%inexhaustible vows%};
rather, {%unlimited terms%}; S. uses the same transl. for
{@niṣṭhā-pada@}, q.v. It seems, indeed, that these two
formally opposite expressions, {%unlimited term%} and {%funda-%}
{%mental term%}, are virtual synonyms. Cf. Dbh 17.9, where
each of the 10 niṣṭhā is specifically said to be aniṣṭhā
(the trick seems to lie in different uses of niṣṭhā: the
{%fundament, basis%} is said to be {%without end or limit, end%}
being also a mg. of niṣṭhā).
