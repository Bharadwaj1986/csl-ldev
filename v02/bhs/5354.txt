{@kṣaya@}¦, m. (as in Skt., and Pali khaya), {%exhaustion,%}
{%perishing, decay%}; (special uses, {@1@}) āyuḥ-kṣayāya Mv
i.52.6, āyuḥkṣayāya ca karmakṣayāya ca i.338.17, (beings
fall from heaven to earth) {%in order to ‘exhaust’%} (work out,
finish) {%their%} (destined) {%life%} (and the force of their past
deeds); so, I agree with Senart, the text seems to mean;
but in the Pali form of the same passage DN i.17.27 we
find ablatives, āyukkhayā vā puññakkhayā vā, {%because%}
{%of the exhaustion of their lives%} (in heaven) {%or of their merits%}
(entitling them to live there, they fall to earth); ({@2@}) kṣaya-
jñāna (= Pali khayañāṇa), {%knowledge of%} (the fact of)
{%decay, perishability%}, in °na-lābhikaṃ kuśalamūlam Mvy
1209; a-śuddha-kṣayajñāna-viṣayiṇāṃ Laṅk 17.6--7, {%that%}
{%do not belong to the sphere of pure knowledge of perishability(?)%}
[({@3@}) in Gv 106.5 and 18 read {@akṣaya@}, q.v., for kṣaya,
a high number.]
