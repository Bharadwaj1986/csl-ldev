{@? dardurā@}¦ (most mss. dardarā), sc. lipi, a kind of
script: Mv i.135.7. Senart's note mentions this as one of
the forms in the list which ‘ne laissent guère d'incertitude’;
to me it is by no means clear. Did Senart mean to associate
it with the Skt. name of the mountain range, often asso-
ciated with Malaya? As a mountain name. Dardara (rare
and doubtful in Skt., but in Pali Daddara) would merit
consideration, as supported by most mss. But one would
not expect a mountain-name here.
