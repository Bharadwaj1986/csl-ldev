{@praskanda, °dha@}¦ (?), in SP 54.8 (vs) adj., {%fallen,%}
{%sinking%}: praskanda (sc. sattvān; acc. pl.) saṃsāri, {%(I see%}
{%creatures) fallen into (sinking in) the saṃsāra%}; note in KN
says praskanna is to be expected, and WT read so, by
em.; Pali pakkhanna is said in PTSD to be often written
pakkhanta; AMg. pakkhanda = {%moving, walking%}, Rat-
nach.; in LV 104.18 (prose) nānā-kudṛṣṭi-grahaṇa-(read
gahana-, below)-praskandhānāṃ (so!, dh) sattvānāṃ,
paralleled by Gv 288.13 dṛṣṭi-kṛta-gahana-praskandhānāṃ
sattvānāṃ; Tib. on LV ḥthibs pos, {%dense, close, a covering%},
confirming gahana as in Gv for grahaṇa; khebs pa, {%cover-%}
{%ing%}, for praskandha; see below, and note Dhātup. root
skandh as v.l. for skand; twice Mvy has what may be
the same word, but both times there are variants in the
text, and northern translations are confused; Mvy 6815
praskandaḥ, v.l. °dhaḥ (so, °dhaḥ, Mironov); Tib. ḥjug
pa, or, ḥgro ba (both something like {%enter%} or {%move%}), or
skem pa ({%dry up!%}); Chin. {%going in%}, or, {%going away%}; Jap.
{%enter(ing)%}; Mvy 7172 praskannaḥ, v.l. (with Mironov)
praskandhaḥ (Mir. v.l. °ndaḥ, and, above line, skannaḥ);
Tib. rab tu zhug pa ({%entering%}), or byiṅ ba ({%sinking%}); so
Chin., {%going inside%}, or {%sinking%}. The mg. {%sinking%}, as adj.,
which fits Skt. pra-skand-fairly well, would fit both the
SP passage and the LV-Gv parallel passages, {%of creatures%}
{%sinking%} ({%entered%} would also be possible) {%in the thicket of%}
{%heresy%}.
