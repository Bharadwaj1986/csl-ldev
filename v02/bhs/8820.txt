{@pattrachedaka@}¦ (so Index and Mironov, text °ika),
m., Mvy 3792, acc. to Tib. glegs ({%board%}, esp. {%panel of a%}
{%door%}, Mvy 5567) ḥbra (?this word I have not found)
mkhan ({%one who is concerned with%}); so, perhaps, {%board%}
or {%door-panel cutter%}; but AMg. patta-chejja is said to mean
{%art of shooting leaves%} (with an arrow), and cf. patta-chejjaka,
{%activity of one who shoots down leaves from a tree(!)%}. Cf.
Jacobi, Ausgew. Erz. 19.37 (here piercing leaves with
pebbles). In any case, designation of some trade or occu-
pation. Chin. is obscure; Jap. {%paper-maker%} (note pattra
also of leaves used for writing!).
