{@-vipakṣa@}¦, adj., in karma deśāntara-vipakṣaṃ, {%an act%}
{%which has its fruition (result) in a foreign country%}: Karmav
30.20; 50.12, 14; 57.4; 64.13. So the mss. always, kept
by Lévi in 30.20, otherwise em. to vipākaṃ; but the form
is clearly a hyper-Sktism for MIndic (Pali) vipakka =
Skt. vipakva, confused with MIndic vipakkha = vipakṣa.
