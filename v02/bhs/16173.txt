{@? samūhati@}¦, {%raises%}: āśvāsapraśvāsā uparudhvā (mss.
[Page575-a+ 71]
°ruddhā) ūrdhvaṃ śīṛṣakapālaṃ vātā praharetsu samū-
hetsuḥ (v.l. samuttejetsuḥ) Mv ii.125.6; I believe this
would have to be an anomalous denom. to {@samūhata@},
q.v., in the different meaning of {%raised%}, which is found
also with {@ūhata@}, q.v.; or at least, this form, if correct,
must have been influenced by that word. But it may be
that we should read samūhanetsuḥ, to *samūhanati, on
the basis of the Pali parallel MN i.243.23 vātā muddhānaṃ
ūhananti ({%raise%}); the LV version is confused and doubtful,
vāyur ūrdh(v)aṃ śiraḥkapālam (mss. °lām) upanihanti
(v.l. upasaṃharati) 252.1, and āśvāsapraśvāsā ūrdh(v)aṃ
śiraḥkapālam (v.l. °lā) upanighnanti (v.l. samuvaghnanti)
3--4; Senart implausibly connects the word with the noun
samūha, detaching it from its evident direct object śīrṣa-
kapālaṃ.
