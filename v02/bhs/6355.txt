{@caitasika@}¦, fem. {@°kī@}, adj., rarely quasi-subst. with
ellipsis of dharma, sometimes written {@cetasika@}, q.v.
(= Pali cetasika); in the following cait° is written except
in the passages listed s.v. {@cet°@}; {%mental, of the mind%}: often
contrasted with kāyika, sometimes also with vācika; sarva-
kāyika-caitasika-prapīḍitāny Gv 96.4; kāyika-caitasi-
kaṃ…sukhaṃ 169.10; kāyikaṃ caitasikaṃ (sc. sukham)
Bbh 26.2; cetasikena (parallel to kāyikena and vācikena)
sthāmena Mv ii.260.7; kāyikaṃ ca me duḥkhaṃ cetasikaṃ
ca Av i.31.14; kāyikāḥ klamāḥ caitasikāḥ (so!) apy
upāyāsāḥ Bbh 194.21; without such contrasting words,
°kī (sc. vedanā) Mvy 7551; caitasikenābhyāsena Śikṣ 33.16;
cittāni caitasika-saṃjñi (acc. pl. of -saṃjñā) vitarkitāni
LV 151.13; esp. with dharma, regularly pl., {%mental states%}
or {%conditions of existence%}, °kā dharmāḥ Mvy 1922; read
cetasikā in Mv iii.66.7, 14 (ye…dharmā pratītya utpad-
[Page233-b+ 71]
yante, so substantially with mss.,…) te…cetasikā
(Senart vedayitā; mss. in 14 cetasitā or °yitā, one ms. in
7 veṭayitā); na cittaṃ na cetasikā dharmāḥ KP 103.5,
{%there is no mind, no mental states of existence%}; cittacaitasi-
kānām eva dharmāṇām Bbh 99.4, and °kā dharmāḥ 5,
apparently {%the mind's mental states, states that are mental%}
{%as belonging to the mind%} (?), cf. Pali citta-cetasikā dhammā,
Dhammasaṅgaṇi 1022 ff. But in other occurrences of both
together, in Pali and BHS, cittam and caitasikā dharmāḥ
(cetasikā dhammā), or caitasika (usually masc. pl.) with
dh° understood, constitute a duality, {%the mind and mental%}
{%states-of-being%}. (For Pali see e.g. Vism. i.84.25 citta-
cetasikānaṃ samaṃ sammā ca ādhānaṃ; {%mind and%}
{%mental properties%}, Maung Tin.) Cf. KP 103.5, above, and:
kuśalānāṃ ca citta-caitasikānām (so read) anusmṛtir
Śikṣ 33.13, {%remembrance of meritorious mind and mental%}
{%states%}. In Divy 352.15 kīdṛśās te cittacetasikāḥ (certainly
sc. dharmāḥ) pravartante, kliṣṭā vākliṣṭā vā, and similarly
in the sequel, the cpd. may perhaps be a Tatp., {%mental%}
{%states of the mind%}, rather than a dvandva. On the other
hand cf. Sūtrāl. xi.30, comm., marīcikopamau dvau dhar-
mau, cittaṃ caitasikāś ca; here the duality is obvious, and
dharmāḥ is certainly to be supplied with cait°. In AbhidhK.
the usual equivalent is {@caitta@}, q.v.; note that the word
dharma regularly has to be supplied, or at least is not
expressed, but note LaV-P. viii.159 avasthāviśeṣo 'pi hi
nāma cetasaś caitasiko bhavati (is dharmaḥ here also to
be supplied with the masc. quasi-subst. caitasiko ?). As
in Sūtrāl. above, they are false, delusive, illusory.
