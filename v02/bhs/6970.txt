{@tiṣṭhatu@}¦ (3 sg. impv. of sthā; = Pali tiṭṭhatu; so
far as I know, not so used in Skt.), {%be it so! all right!%} as
formula of assent: tiṣṭhatu tāva LV 287.19 (vs), in Svastika's
response to the Bodhisattva's request for grass; rendered
by Tib. freely, khyod bzhes śig, {%do you take it!%} (qy: did
Tib. possibly take tāva as = tava, and understand literally
{%let it remain yours?%}).
