{@kṣudra-pāka@}¦, adj., {%very ripe%}, of fruits in the last
month of summer: Mv iii.143.(14--)15 (grīṣmāṇāṃ) paścime
māse kṣudrapākāni phalāni bhuktāni, whereupon he was
thirsty, drank much cold water, and got indigestion;
substantially the same, 144.5; 153.10; the mg. seems
guaranteed by 154.6 where pakva-supakvāni replaces
kṣudrapākāni, in what is otherwise virtually the same
phrase. Cf. Skt. svādupāka, defined BR as {%was sich süss,%}
{%angenehm kocht%}, d. h. {%verdaut%}; {@kṣudra@} here means {%honey-%}
{%like = sweet%} (see s.v.). In Mv iii.154.14 the ṛṣi who had
the above adventure squeezes such fruits (so that the
juice falls) into the mouth of the infant born to the doe
who drank his seed: ṛṣi kṣudrapākāni phalāni mukhe
pīḍeti.The interpretation is further confirmed by Mv
iii.145.2 kṣudra-kṣudrāṇi phalāni (on which see {@kṣudra@}),
of the fruits fed by the ṛṣi to the young Ekaśṛṅga(ka).
It seems that the ṛṣi's indigestion was caused by the
excessive amount of cold water he drank, not by the
fruits.
