{@yāvat, yāva, (1)@}¦ (= Pali yāva, Vin. ii.196.5 yāva
pāpo ayaṃ Devadatto; see also Childers s.v.), {%how%} (ex-
clamatory)…! Skt. would use an interrog., not rel.;
the origin of the idiom may be seen in such a sentence
as: āścaryam adbhutam idaṃ paśyatha yāvat mahard-
dhikaḥ śāstā Mv i.206.11 = ii.10.5 (vs), {%see this wonder%}
{%and marvel, the extent to which the Teacher is…!%}; aho
yāva kalyāṇā…dhārmikā ca Mv i.350.7; so also i.301.16;
303.8 (acc. to Senart; I am not certain of this); 365.7;
ii.10.7; iii.412.10; see {@yādṛśa@}, once used similarly; ({@2@}) {%as%}
{%far as%}, indicating omission of part of a quoted or repeated
passage, which is to be supplied (this usage seems not
recorded): yāva Mv i.52.9; ii.428.14 (v.l. yāvad); yāvad
Mv i.339.7, 12; Śikṣ 6.1 etc., very common here. Differs
from {@peyālaṃ@} and equivalents in that yāva(t) is always
followed by the concluding word(s) of the passage, while
peyālaṃ need not be; {@(3) yāvac ca…yāvac ca@} (spatially)
{%from…to%} (this usage not noted elsewhere); the nouns
are in acc., nom., rarely abl.; after the second, the phrase
may (but need not) be concluded by atrāntare, {%in the%}
{%space between%} (Mv ii.150.2; MSV ii.74.15; Divy 574.28),
atrāntarā (Av i.107.10--11), {@antarāt@} (q.v., Divy 386.9--10),
tasminn antare (LV 273.9--10), etad antaram (Divy 250.7);
the ca after the first yāvat is rarely omitted (so in the
first ex.): yāvad rājakulaṃ yāvac ca udyānabhūmiṃ
atrāntare Mv ii.150.2; so, yāva(c) ca…yāva(c) ca, withs
accs., ii.150.7; 151.19; 153.14; 156.6; yāvac ca Mathurāṃ
yāvac ca Pāṭaliputram Divy 386.9--10; veṇuvanaṃ…
rājagṛham Av i.107.10--11; with noms., MSV ii.74.15;
yāva(c) ca bodhi (or bodhir) yāva(c) ca Vārāṇasī (v.l.
°sīṃ, once °sīyo), {%from the bodhi-tree to Benares%}, Mv iii.
323.10, 14; 324.3; vihāro…nagaram Divy 250.7; gṛhaṃ
…nadī, {%from the house to the river%}, Divy 574.28; with
abl., yāvac ca nadyā Nairañjanāyā yāvac ca bodhimaṇ-
ḍādes (vv.ll. °maṇḍād, °maṇḍas) LV 273.9, {%from the river%}
{%N. to the bodhi-tree%}. See also {@yāvatā, yāvad etto@} (s.v.
{@etto@}), {@yāvad eva@}.
