{@vyāskandaka-@}¦, a kind of {@samāpatti@}, q.v.: Mvy
1497 (Mironov {@vya°@}). Tib. renders by snrel zhi, which
usually = {@vyatyasta@} (q.v. 2), and Mvy ed. suggests
reading so; cf. {@vyutkrāntaka@}. It would seem to be, like
the latter, a manner of skipping from one trance-state
to a non-adjoining one. But Chin. has the equivalent of
nāsaṃjñāyatana, which as Ting says seems ‘an abbre-
viation’ (the last part) of {@naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana@}.
