{@maitrāsa-tā@}¦ (for *maitrāṃśa-tā, below; § 3.3), {%loving-%}
{%kindness, benevolence%}, is the stem to be assumed Mv iii.373.11
(vs), where read: maitrāsatāṃ (or °taṃ, MIndic for °tāṃ;
mss. cited as °naṃ or °na; Senart em. maitrābhāvanāṃ,
metr. impossible and otherwise implausible) bhāvaye
apramatto, maitreṇa cittena hitānukampī, etc. The stem
maitrāsa = Pali mettāsa, which occurs as v.l. for met-
taṃso Itiv. 22.4; in the same vs Jāt. iv.71.25 mettaṃso
is glossed 72.5 by metta-koṭṭhāso (for *koṭṭhaṃso!) met-
tacitto; the word is a noun, not an adj. as stated in PTSD,
and means the same as BHS maitrāsa-tā (for *maitrāṃ-
śatā); otherwise BHS records only maitra (adj.) as separate
word with {@aṃśa@} (q.v., 2) in the mg. of the cpd. The use
of -āsa for -āṃśa (Pali -aṃsa) is confirmed by Pali koṭ-
ṭhāsa.
