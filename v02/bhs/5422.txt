({@khaja@}¦, as in Skt., {%churning-stick, stirring stick%}; Skt.
Lex. also {%spoon, ladle%}: Laṅk 340.8 (vs), repeating 203.15:
khaja- (203.15 kheja, mere corruption)-mṛd-daṇḍa- (203.15
bhāṇḍa)-cakrādi bījabhūtādi (i.e. all material things)
bāhiram (sc. constituent of the {@saṃkalā@} or {@śaṃ°@}, q.v.).
Ed. note on 203.15 seems to indicate support in northern
translations for mantha = khaja. No need to em. to
dhvaja as suggested in ed. on 340.8 and Suzuki's Index.)
