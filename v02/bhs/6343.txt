{@? cetayika@}¦ (v.l. ve°), Mv iii.442.10, some sort of enter-
tainer. Form and mg. alike obscure; no correspondent in
parallel passages iii.113.4 (see Senart's note here) etc. If
the reading ve- were accepted, one might think of reading
vetālika or °ḍika (Skt. vaitālika), were it not for the fact
that this word seems likely to have been read in 442.8
in the same list (Senart here tālika, but mss. vetaddika,
vetarddi°), and in 113.2 Senart em. vaitālika for mss.
tetalika, tetarika.
