{@okasta@}¦, taken by Senart i note p. 556 as ppp. of ava
with root kas (see BR), {%gone down, descended%}. I cannot
improve on this suggestion, altho no form of this cpd. has
been recorded elsewhere. Usually with acc. or loc. of that
to (sometimes into) which the subject has {%gone down%},
the pple. °to or °tā being a periphrasis for a past tense:
to the sea, in order to embark, Mv i.245.4; to a river,
ii.212.15 (to draw water); iii.313.8; to a pool, ii.450.2 (by
a staircase, sopānena), 15; iii.24.19; 29.16; from the
Himalayan region into another country Mv i.232.3 (text
uncertain), 12; to the bazaar-street iii.35.17; 37.3; from
a wagon iii.39.16; a nāga enters into the Buddha's alms-
bowl, iii.429.3. Not found outside of Mv.
