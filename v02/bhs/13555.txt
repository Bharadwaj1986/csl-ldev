2 {@Vālikā@}¦ (text Bāl°), n. of a Licchavi woman; and
{@Vālikāchavī@} (text Bāl°, with 1 ms. Bālika-, v.l. Pārika-
lecchavī, which suggests that the second member was a
form of the tribal name!), n. of a place donated by her
to the Buddha and the order (identified by Senart with
Pāli Vālikārāma, v.l. Vālukā°; Pali seems to know no
Vālikā; the v.l. suggests the word for {%sand%}): Mv i.300.17,
printed, bālikāye bhagavataḥ saśrāvakasaṃghasya bhak-
taṃ kṛtvā Bālikāchavī niryātitā. Does the name of the
place mean {%Vālikā's radiance%}, or {%having a covering of sand%}
(the woman's name being secondarily based upon the
place name)?
