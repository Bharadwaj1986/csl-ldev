{%doctrine%} or {%to religion, way of entering%} it; so correctly Bur-
nouf on SP 53.5, {%introductions à la loi%}, confirmed by Tib.
on LV 161.14 chos kyi sgo rnam, {%doors%} or {%entrances to the%}
{%doctrine%} or {%to religion%}. They are usually said to be very
numerous: dharmāmukhā (°mā° m.c.) koṭisahasr’ aneke
prakāśayiṣyanti anāgate 'dhve SP 53.5 (vs); asaṃkhye-
yāni dharmamukha-śatasahasrāṇi niścaranti sma LV 128.8
(as the alphabet is recited, religious dicta come forth);
a formulaic list, beginning (akṣayavimokṣa)-saṃbhedaṃ
nāma dharmamukha(ṃ) Gv 195.24; sarvadharmaśubha-
vyūhaṃ nāma dharmam° 196.3, and others in 196.5--6, 8,
11, 14, 17, 20, etc. (the names are pompous but unilluminat-
ing); (sarvaromamukhebhyo) vividhāni dharmamukhāni
niścaramāṇāny aśrauṣīt Gv 515.5, foll. by: yad uta, bo-
dhisattvaguṇavarṇa-mukhāni dānapāramitā-mukhāni etc.
(the cpds. become longer and more embracing as they
proceed); precisely {%four%} are listed in LV 182.5 ff., (bodhi-
sattvaḥ…) catvāri dharmamukhāny āmukhīkaroti sma…
(6) yad idaṃ…catuḥsaṃgrahavastu-prayoga-nirhāra-
viśuddhiṃ ca nāma dharmamukhaṃ…(and three other
even more complicated ones, showing no clear relation
to the Gv lists; it seems clear that there was no standard
or accepted list); (bodhisattvāḥ…) dharmamukhaiḥ
saṃcoditavyā bhavanti LV 161.14, {%are to be instigated%} (to
withdraw from the world) {%by%} (the utterance of) {%intro-%}
{%ductions to religion%} (such as those which then follow in
verses).
