({@ca@}¦, as in normal Skt. (BR; Speyer, Skt. Synt. § 441b,
VSS § 282), is used ({@1@}) in sentences where a contrast
seems implied, = tu, {%but%}: te caivaṃ vācaṃ bhāṣeran, tac
ca bhaiṣajyam upanāmitaṃ na pibeyuḥ SP 321.10--11,
{%on the one hand%} (ca) {%they would speak thus, and yet%} (ca;
{%on the other hand%}) {%they would not drink the proffered remedy%};
({@2@}) in the protasis of conditions, = yadi (acc. to Speyer,

VSS l.c., ‘in Vedic and older Skt.,’ but this is too limited):
deśayeyaṃ cāhaṃ dharmaṃ na vā deśayeyam LV 400.7,
{%whether I preach the dharma or not%}--(the same result,
as regards some people, will ensue); śakraś ca (mss.,
Senart em. ce) me varaṃ dadyāt Mv iii.6.15, {%if Śakra%}
{%should give me a boon%}--. ({@3@}) Acc. to Senart, MV i notes
pp. 370, 501, 561, ca may introduce a following word,
[Page221-a+ 71]
as ‘proclitic’, no longer enclitic; he says the same is
authorized for Pali by the Mukhamattadīpanī, a comm.
on Kaccāyana. Alleged cases are cited in Mv i.3.11; 57.10;
83.17 (? read 16?); 158.1; 241.13. In some of these (e.g.
158.1) ca seems to me quite normal; in others the position
may be peculiar, as sometimes it is in Pali, see Childers
s.v., but I do not believe it ever introduces a following
word or phrase; some of the passages cited are violently
emended by Senart in other respects. The Pali Dictt. do
not recognize the usage alleged by Senart, and I am not
convinced that it occurs in BHS.)
