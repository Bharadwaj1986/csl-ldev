{@paritasana@}¦, nt. (prob. MIndic for °tṛṣ° to Pali pari-
tasati, and esp. °tasita, ppp., see {@paritṛṣita@}), {%great longing%},
= utkaṇṭhā: tāṃs tathāgatān apaśyan (pres. pple.) maha-
tīm utkaṇṭhāṃ paritasanaṃ cāpannaḥ AsP 494.8 (prose),
sc. to see the vision which had disappeared. Cf. also prec.
The neg. {@a-paritasana@}, q.v., has been noted only as a
noun from the different verb {@parit(r)as(y)ati@}; in Pali
the two seem to be confused, at least if the Pali Dictt.
are to be trusted. It must be noted, however, that the
meaning {%discouragement, mental trouble%} (as in {@a-parita-@}
{@syana@} etc., cf. {@paritasyati, °tras°@}) would be possible in
the above AsP passage, and could also be the meaning
of {@utkaṇṭhā@}, as in Pali ukkaṇṭhā and BHS {@utkaṇṭhati@};
the disappearance of the vision could lead to {%depression%}
of mind, as well as to {%eager desire%} to see it again.
