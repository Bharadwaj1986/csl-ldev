{@Virūpākṣa@}¦ (= Pali Virūpakkha), ({@1@}) n. of one of
the ‘world-guardians’, see s.v. {@mahārāja(n)@}; Viru° (m.c.)
Samādh p. 42 line 4; guardian of the west, and lord of
nāgas; doubtless intended by the nāga-king of this name
Māy 247.18; ({@2@}) pl., used (as also in Pali) of nāgas, pre-
sumably as followers of Virūpākṣa: Māy 221.15; ({@3@}) sg.,
Virūpākṣaḥ (alone!) as final colophon, Sādh 601.4, perhaps
meant as name of the author of the last section? (But
the usual way in Sādh of indicating authors' names is
something like kṛtiḥ plus gen. of the name.)
