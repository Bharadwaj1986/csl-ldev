adorned, and scented his body) svakam adhiṣṭhānam akarot

home and appear in Kapilavastu); -devatādhiṣṭhānāt LV

wagons were stopped and could not be moved); usually a
Buddha's or Bodhisattva's; it may be his {%supernatural%}
{%control%} over his own destiny, SP 64.13, where bodhisattvā-
dhiṣṭhānena goes closely with tat paurvakaṃ caryāpraṇi-
dhānam, see s.v. {@saṃmantrita@}; but it is usually {%control%}
over another person, a Bodhisattva or disciple: Maitreyasya
bodhisattvasyādhiṣṭhānabalena sarveṣu teṣu kūṭāgāreṣv
abhyantarapraviṣṭam ātmānaṃ saṃjānīte sma, Gv 512.13-

adhisthān°; when the women were making music for the
Bodhisattva) {%by the supernatural power of the Buddhas%}
verses of exhortation to him came forth (in 163.14 {@āveśa@},
q.v., or v.l. ādeśa, replaces adhi°); similarly 182.3; adhi-
ṣṭhānena buddhānām anubhāvād (another near-synonym)
vikurvitaiḥ Samādh 22.19 (the body of the Buddha can
be seen); other like cases Laṅk 2.10; LV 31.3, 6; 237.18;
368.12; in 415.16, the dharmacakra is sarvabuddhādhiṣ-
ṭhānāvilopitam, {%unbroken thru the supernatural power%}
(influence) {%of all the Buddhas%}; for Laṅk 100.6 and Mmk
56.24 see s.v. {@adhitiṣṭhati@} (2); etaṃ…samādhiṃ samā-
pannasyādhiṣṭhānam: lokadhātuvijñaptiṣu adhiṣṭhānam,
etc., long series of locs. each with adhi° repeated, stating
the spheres of the {%mastery%} obtained, Gv 98.15 ff.; mamā-
dhiṣṭhānabalādhānam SP 316.1, {%my assumption of the force%}
{%of supernatural%} (magic) {%power%} (here causes people to believe
that the earthly life of Śākyamuni, which was unreal, is
real); but the corresponding verse, 323.13, has adhiṣṭha-
hāmi in the sense of {%I make appear by magic%} (see {@adhitiṣ-@}
{@ṭhati@} 3), and possibly adhiṣṭhāna may be concrete here
(and in sadādhiṣṭhānaṃ mama etad īdṛśaṃ SP 324.11,
resuming the same subject), {%exhibition of supernatural%}
(magic) {%power = magical appearance%} or {%transformation%};
this latter is certainly the meaning in LV 379.3, see
{@adhitiṣṭhati@} (3), and perhaps in Prabhūtaratnasya
tathāgatasya…etad adhiṣṭhānam abhūt SP 241.8, {%this%}
{%was the adhiṣṭhāna of the Tathāgata P%}. (there follows a
quotation of his words: {%Let this stūpa of my remains appear%}
{%whenever the SP is preached%}). Does {%this adhiṣṭhāna%} mean
{%this exhibition of supernatural power%}, viz, the making of the
stūpa to appear? Or is it {%this fixed determination, resolution%}
(2, above)? Near synonyms are {@āveśa@}, (Skt.) anubhāva,
{@adhimukti@}; cf. also Laṅk 292.13 and 15, where one of the
sources of abhijñā is ‘from adhiṣṭhāna’ (adhiṣṭhānān, so
read in 13 for text °nāṃ, abl., before n-), which means
{%from the controlling power of the Buddhas%} and is paraphrased
in 15 by buddhaprasādataḥ, {%from the grace of the Buddhas%}.
Suzuki, Transl. of Laṅk passim, renders {%sustaining power%};
I think rather {%controlling power%}. Even Bodhisattvas are
at times dependent on Buddhas and need their control;
({@4@}) in architecture, Skt. (see Acharya, Dict. Hindu Arch.
s.v.), {%basement, foundation%} of building or {%base%} of a pillar.
Here in Mvy 5591 = Tib. lan kan gyi rten ma, {%prop%} (i.e.
base) {%of a railing%}; so Chin. Whatever it means here is
certainly meant also in Divy 221.9, 10 adhiṣṭhānam, and
Mv i.195.1 ff.; iii.227.8 ff., adhiṣṭhānakam, where the
context is the same as in Mvy 5591; see {@sūcī, sūcikā;@}
{@(5)@} see {@pādādhiṣṭhāna; (6)@} m., n. of a (mythical) samādhi:
Gv 451.26. In this curious passage, 451.25--452.6, the word
adhiṣṭhāna is further used predicatively in a series of
equational sentences, varying in gender like an adjective
[Page016-b+ 71]
with different subjects. Bhadrottamā says to Sudhana:
ahaṃ kulaputrā 'nālayamaṇḍalaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ
jānāmi deśayāmy, adhiṣṭhānaś ca me samādhiḥ pratilab-
dho; na tatra samādhau kasyacid dharmasyā 'dhiṣṭhānam;
adhiṣṭhānaṃ tatra sarvajñatācakṣuḥ pravartate, 'dhiṣṭhā-
naṃ sarvajñatāśrotram, adhiṣṭhānaṃ sarvajñatāghrāṇam,
adhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatājihvā, 'dhiṣṭhānaḥ sarvajñatākāyo,
'dhiṣṭhānaṃ tatra sarvajñatāmanaḥ pravartate, 'dhiṣṭhānā
sarvajñatormir, adhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatāvidyud, adhiṣṭhānāḥ
sarvajñatāvegāḥ pravartante jagadrocanāmaṇḍalāḥ; etam
ahaṃ kulaputrā 'nālayamaṇḍalaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ jā-
nāmi.(Punctuation introduced by me.) There is no further
light from the context. I am not sure what meaning the
author attributed to the word adhiṣṭhāna: presumably
something like either {%basis%} or {%controlling power%}.
