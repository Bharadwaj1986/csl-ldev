{@a-paritarṣaṇā@}¦ (if neg. to BHS {@paritarṣaṇā@}, q.v.),
{%not craving%} (so Bendall and Rouse): Śikṣ 183.5 cittasyāna-
valīnatā 'navamṛdyatā 'paritarṣaṇā. There is no doubt
that BHS paritarṣaṇā means {%desire%}. But CPD derives
Pali (a)paritassanā from root tras (while noting that
comms. derive from tṛṣ), and this seems to get some
support from the two preceding and parallel nouns in
Śikṣ; perhaps, then, after all, {%the not being wearied, depres-%}
{%sed, or anxious%}. Cf. {@paritasyati@}.
