{@vāraṇa@}¦ (m., = Pali id.; ignored by Senart), a kind
of bird, which had a pleasant voice (Jāt. vi.539.16) and
beautiful eyes (Mv); only in cpd. °ṇa-cakora-nayana: Mv
iii.259.6; 267.15; 269.15; applied to Yaśodharā and Rāhula.
In some Pali texts identified with the hatthiliṅga (cf.
vāraṇa, {%elephant%}), which is described as {%a sort of vulture%}
{%with a bill like an elephant's trunk%} (Childers, PTSD); but
it seems questionable whether such attractive qualities as
the above would be attributed to any vulture-like bird.
