{%ginning%}; in names of penances for monks, {@mūla-parivāsa@}
(see {@parivāsa@}), {%probation starting over from the beginning%}
because the original offense was repeated while parivāsa
was in force (see {@antar-āpatti@}): Mvy 8650; MSV ii.207.15;
iii.35.6 ff. (explained); {@mūla-pārivāsika@}, {%one undergoing%}
{%this penance%}, MSV iii.37.15 etc.; {@mūlāpakarṣa-parivāsa@},
{%probation starting a second time from the beginning%} because
the offense was repeated while mūla-parivāsa was in force
(see {@praty-antarāpatti@}), Mvy 8651; MSV ii.207.15; this
is abbreviated to {@mūlāpakarṣa@}, m., MSV iii.38.11 etc.,
41.13; in Pali, instead of mūlaparivāsa and mūlāpakarṣa-
(parivāsa), there seems to be a single category, samo-
dhāna-parivāsa, often qualified by mūlāya paṭikassantā
(Vin. ii.7.20) or the like (N. Dutt, MSV iii Introd. iv f.
makes Pali mūlāya paṭikassanā and samodhāna-parivāsa
separate penances corresp. to the above two in BHS,
[Page437-a+ 71]
but this seems hardly supported by Pali evidence; possibly
Vin. ii.62.6--12 may imply it, but it is not very clear).
There is also mention of {@mūla-mānāpya@} and {@mūlāpa-@}
{@karṣa-mān°@}, which are analogous to {@mūla-parivāsa@}
and {@mūlāpakarṣa-p°@}, except that acc. to MSV iii.77.2
and 5 the repeated faults are concealed (altho the fault
leading to the original mānāpya was, of course, uncon-
cealed, 76.20--21; otherwise parivāsa, not mānāpya, would
have been the penalty); in a similar case iii.81.16 ff. the
original and repeated faults are all unconcealed, leading
to mūla-mānāpya 82.9 and mūlāpakarṣa-m° 83.2; ({@4@}) nt.
