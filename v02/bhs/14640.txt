{@vyapatrāpya@}¦, nt. (as prec.; cf. {@apatrāpya@}), {%shame,%}
{%modesty, bashfulness%}: lajjā-°pya-saṃlīna-cetās Divy 255.16,
hrī-°pya-gṛhītā 23 (here the bashfulness of love); {%shame%}
of an evil deed, (śikṣāvyatikrame) °pyam utpadyate Bbh
137.20; in this sense in cpd. hrī-°pya, °pyaṃ prāviṣkaroti
Bbh 6.1; similarly 137.25 f.; 159.14; 180.2; 250.8 (katamad
bodhisattvānāṃ hrī-vyapatrāpyaṃ); a distinction between
hrī and vyapa° is made in Bbh 250.10--12, where both are
glossed lajjā, but hrī is said to mean the feeling that a
blameworthy act is unworthy of oneself, vyapatrāpya
is the feeling caused thereby thru fear or respect of others.
Is this anything more than a commentator's ad-hoc
attempt at subtlety ? In AbidhK. LaV-P. ii.172 hrī is
defined in a way suggesting rather vyapatrāpya of
Bbh.
