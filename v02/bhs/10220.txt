{@pratītya-samutpāda@}¦, m. (= Pali paṭicca-samup-
pāda; commonly taken as cpd. in both languages; see
{@pratītya@}), {%origination by dependence%} of one thing on an-
other; applied to the celebrated ‘chain of causation’, the
(usually twelve) steps of which are the same as in Pali,
from avidyā to (a compound ending in) upāyāsa: elaborate
analysis Śāl 76.13 ff. (valuable discussion by LaVallée
Poussin), cited Śikṣ 219.10 ff.; more briefly Dbh 48.23 ff.;
schematic lists of the terms, Mvy 2241-58; Dharmas 42;
SP 179.4 ff.; Mv ii.285.8 ff.; 345.13 ff.; iii.448.12 ff.; Av
ii.105.16 ff.; KP 61, 62; Suv 193.9 ff.; an approximate,
not quite complete, analysis in reverse order (some of

300.18; 487.24; 547.19; 549.12, 15; Av i.287.14; Gv 89.13,
etc. The standard list may be cited from Mvy 2241 ff.,
where the twelfth item is split up into its elements, not
put into a cpd. as often: 1 avidyā, 2 saṃskāra (here sg.),
3 vijñāna, 4 nāmarūpa, 5 ṣaḍāyatana (here sg.), 6 sparśa,
