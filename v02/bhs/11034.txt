{@bodhisattva@}¦ (= Pali °satta), {%person destined for%}
{%enlightenment, Buddha-to-be%}, passim; Mvy 625, followed by
list of standard epithets of such persons incl. {@jinaputra@};
other epithets meaning {%son of Buddha%} are frequent; there
are many lists of names, such as the 92 beginning Mvy 645;
each name in such lists as occur in works here included is,
generally speaking, recorded in this Dict., but e.g. the list
Mmk 8.21 ff. is omitted because it is very corrupt and
obscure, even the word-division being often doubtful;
eight special B's listed Dharmas 12, {@Maitreya, Gagana-@}
{@gañja, Samantabhadra, Vajrapāṇi, Mañjuśrī, Sarva-@}
{@nivaraṇaviṣkambhin, Kṣitigarbha, Khagarbha@}, qq.v.;
in SP 64.12--13 (sa tvaṃ) Śāriputra bodhisattva-saṃman-
tritena °ttva-rahasyeneha mama pravacana upapannaḥ, sa
tvaṃ…bodhisattvādhiṣṭhānena…, refers to Śāriputra's
own {@saṃmantrita@} (q.v.) etc. as a Bodhisattva, not (with
Burnouf and Kern) to the Buddha's (they use the word
Bodhisattva in translating, but understand it as referring
to the Buddha, which is contrary to usage).
