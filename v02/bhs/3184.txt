{@irṣyā@}¦ = Skt. īrṣyā, {%jealousy%}: all mss. at LV 52.13;
372.17. Weller 20 would em. to īrṣyā; but this may be
only Sktization of semi-MIndic ir°, cf. {@iryā-@} etc. As Weller
notes, irṣyā is found as v.l. in some mss. of Mv (i.37.6;
44.13, four of six mss.; iii.27.17; 164.19); tho in all these
cases at least one ms. has īr°, the form ir° may have been
original.
