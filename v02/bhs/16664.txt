{@sātīyati@}¦, text, or {@sādīyati@}, Kashgar rec. (see below,
and cf. {@svādīyati@}), in SP 277.8 (prose), {%interests oneself in,%}
{%shows attachment to, takes pleasure in%}: (na ca śrāmaṇeraṃ)
na ca śrāmaṇerīṃ na bhikṣuṃ na bhikṣuṇīṃ na kumā-
rakaṃ na kumārikāṃ °yati, na ca taiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃstavaṃ

[Page590-b+ 71]
etym. uncertain; sātīyati could be denom. from sāta =
{@śāta@}, q.v.; sādīyati prob. = Pali sādiyati, derived by
Childers and PTSD from root svād, cf. {@svādīyati@}; both
these forms could perhaps be caus. pass. of svād- as sug-
gested PTSD, or svād° may (as I am inclined to guess) be
only an unhistorical Sktization, the orig. being denom.
sātīyati, with sādī° showing Prakritic d for t.
