{@saṃparāyika@}¦, adj. (= Pali id., Skt. sāṃpa°; cf.
{@saṃparāya@}), {%of a life after death%}: Ud iv.26 (Lévi JA 1912,
Pt. 2, 269), contrasted with {@dṛṣṭadhārmika@}. But Chakra-
varti, Ud p. 48, assumes that sāṃpa° was read, as in Skt.;
is Lévi's form a misprint? (There are rather numerous
misprints in this text.) The Skt. (or Sktized) adj. {@sāṃ°@},
q.v., is otherwise well known in BHS: Ud v.22; Mvy
2981; 8355; Mv iii.212.6, 8, 9; Bbh 176.24, etc.
