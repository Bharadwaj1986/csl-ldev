{@? rajojala@}¦, nt., Mv iii.412.17 (vs), perhaps intended
as dvandva cpd., {%dirt and water%}; but perhaps same mg.
as rajomalaṃ in same vs (this word occurs in Pali, e.g.
Jāt. i.24.23, in different vs) Divy 339.24, {%dirt and impurity%};
in a list of characteristic practices of ascetics, which are
said to be ineffective for purifying a man still subject
to desire; the vs occurs in Pali Dhp. 141, where edd.
and mss. vary, but Fausböll, 2d ed., rajovajall’; better
with Mrs. Rhys Davids (Minor Anthologies, 1931) rajo
va jall’ (cf. jallaṃ Sn 249), two separate words (va prob.
m.c. for vā); note that Pali repeatedly has rajo-jalla
(PTSD); it is possible that Mv rajojalaṃ stands for (Pali)
rajo-jallaṃ, m.c.; jalla is derived in PTSD from Skt.
*jalya, deriv. of jala (questionable!). The line (in which
Divy prefixes na, unmetrically, before rajomalaṃ) is
completed by votkuṭukaprahāṇaṃ (Mv mss. vo utk°;
Divy notk°; Dhp. ukkuṭikappadhānaṃ).
