<L>9944<pc>361,2<k1>प्रतिकृत्य<k2>प्रतिकृत्य
{@pratikṛtya@}¦, ger. used as adv. (= Pali paṭigacca,
with Pkt. g for k, Geiger 38.1; usually followed by eva,
i.e. °gacc’ eva), {%in advance%}, always foll. by eva: mss.
sometimes pratikṛtyaivaṃ (so LV 182.1); in Mv ii.449.8;
451.14, 16; 454.2, 4; 455.9; 456.14, 18 prakṛ° for pratikṛ°;
and Mv mss. often °tyeva (or °tveva; °tyevaṃ iii.12.9) for
°tyaiva; Senart reads always prakṛtyaiva, rendering
{%simplement, sans aucun appareil qui fasse connaître ton%}
{%rang%} (ii.570), tho his mss. read pratikṛ° in ii.448.16;
449.10; iii.11.18 and 12.9; moreover the mg. he assumes
for his reading prakṛtyaiva can hardly be correct, since
in 449.10 and 451.16 the word is preceded by prākṛtakena
veṣeṇa, {%in common garb%}, which would be duplicated by
the assumed prakṛtyaiva: pratikṛtyaiva (text with mss.
°vaṃ) dharmavihāry…LV 182.1, {%even in advance%} (of
enlightenment, while still dwelling in worldly life, in the
harem), {%he%} (the Bodhisattva) {%was dwelling according to%}
{%what was right%}; Mv ii.448.16; 449.8, 10; 451.14, 16; 454.2,
4; 455.9; 456.14, 18; iii.11.18; 12.9.
