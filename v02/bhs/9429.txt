{@pārājayika@}¦, adj., {%grave, extremely serious%} (sin), =
{@pārājika@}, q.v.; the identity of the two is proved by
°jayikādhyāpanna Bbh 159.22 = Pali (pārājikaṃ) ajjhā-
panna (q.v. in CPD), see {@adhyāpadyate@}; similarly Bbh
180.26, see ibid.; bodhisattvasya catvāraḥ °jayika-sthānīyā
dharmāḥ Bbh 158.3, 5, etc.; 159.3; they are described
in this passage, but bear no resemblance to the four
{@pārājika@} of monks, being evidently a recent invention
patterned on that ancient category.
