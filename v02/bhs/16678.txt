{@sānu-kālam@}¦, adv., {%at%} (some specified, but to me
unknown) {%time%}: gacchāmi sānukālaṃ tasya dārakasya
bhaktaṃ nayāmi (said by the youth's mother); sā °laṃ
gatvā…Divy 88.2--3. One would be tempted to assume
sānu = {@sānuka@} (prec., q.v.), {%at the time of the sānu(ka)%}
{%muhūrta%}; but that muhūrta occurs in the first half of the
night acc. to Divy 643.24, while this passage clearly refers
to daytime.
