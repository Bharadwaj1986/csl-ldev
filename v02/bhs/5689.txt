{@? garbholika@}¦, in upari-garbholikaṃ (to be read as
one word; sc. āsanam) AsP 488.20, {%having%} (some sort of)
{%cover on top%}; parallel to goṇikāstīrṇaṃ, kāsikavastrapratyā-
staraṇaṃ (read kāśi°), etc. The word is otherwise unknown,
obscure in etymology, and perhaps corrupt. Possibly read
for the cpd. a word containing ubhayato-lohita-(upadhā-
naṃ, or the like), cf. Sukh 67.8; Mv ii.115.16--17; iii.70.2
(all similar passages).
