{@utkṣipati@}¦ (Skt. in mg. {%lifts up%}, etc.), ({@1@}) {%lets up%} in
sense of {%permits to ascend%}, opp. {@nikṣipati:@} LV 186.(12--)13f.
ekaikasya ca prāsādasya sopānāni pañca-pañca puruṣa-
śatāny utkṣipanti sma nikṣipanti sma ({%let go up and down%});
teṣāṃ tathotkṣipyamāṇānāṃ nikṣipyamāṇānāṃ ca śabdo
'rdhayojane śrūyate sma; ({@2@}) (= Pali ukkhipati) {%suspends%}
(from the order of monks); ppp. utkṣipta: Bhīk 29b.1
utkṣiptānuvartaka (see {@anuvartaka@}); similarly Mvy 8480
utkṣiptānuvṛttiḥ, {%the following (cleaving to) a suspended%}
(monk), so Tib. spaṅs paḥi…; ({@3@}) {%averts%} (the senses,
particularly the eyes, from forbidden objects): Divy 278.29
indriyāṇy utkṣipati, and in the following lines; indriyāṇy
utkṣipyāvasthitāḥ MSV iii.18.11, {%stood averting their eyes%}
(in embarrassment); in this sense = Pali (indriyāni)
okkhipati from avakṣipati, see {@avakṣipta@}; apparently
BHS utkṣ° is false Skt. for MIndic okkh°; acc. to Chin.
({%eyes not cast to one side%}), anutkṣiptacakṣuṣo Prāt 529.10
would belong here; curiously the Pali equivalent, Vin.
iv.186.29 okkhittacakkhu (note lack of negative!), appears
to mean {%with downcast eyes%}, which the old comm. inter-
prets by observing that it is a sin to enter a house or sit
down {%looking around at this or that%} (tahaṃ tahaṃ olokento),
so that okkhitta-, as opposite of this, would mean essen-
tially the same as BHS an-utkṣipta- as interpreted by
Chin. But for this evidence, an-utkṣipta-might be inter-
preted, in accordance with Skt. usage, as {%not lifted up%}
(thus in another way = okkhitta-).
