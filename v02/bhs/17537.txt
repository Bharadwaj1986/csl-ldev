{@? svaka(m)@}¦ (cf. s.v. {@svayaṃ@}), ({@1@}) acc. to Senart =
Skt. svayam, {%(one)self%}, in Mv iii.126.9, 10; the crow-king
Supātra's minister speaks: (if I cannot fulfil the king's
command, and steal food from the kitchen of the king of
Benares) na puruṣakārakaṃ bhavati (here mss. punctuate)
asmākaṃ, gacchāmi svakaṃ rājño Supātrasya nivedituṃ
(so Senart, but mss. °trasya kāke, or kāka-, niveditaṃ),
mahārāja atra svakaṃ (so Senart em., mss. sekā) mahāna-
sāto rājabhojanaṃ ānemi.The passage seems to me too
uncertain to justify confidence in the em. (which might
be explained as hyper-Skt. for svayaṃ, interpreted as
having Pktic y for k, § 2.33). In the first line the orig.
may have been svakaṃ…niveditaṃ (with mss.); ({@2@}) in
LV 237.16 (vs) Lefm. mahya saṃjñi svakam eva vartate,
which might be rendered {%my own self%} (assuming svakam =
ātmā) {%is having the idea%} (that you will become like the
Highest of Men). But best mss. have saṃjñā for saṃjñi;
meter will be satisfied by saṃjña, and we could interpret
svaka-m-eva, with hiatus-bridging m; then, {%my very own%}
{%notion is…%} In SP 112.8 (vs) read prob. with Nep. mss.
pitā svakasya, {%his own father%}; svakasya = Skt. svasya =
ātmanaḥ.
