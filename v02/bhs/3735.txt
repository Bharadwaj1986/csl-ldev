<L>3735<pc>139,1<k1>उपपादुक<k2>उपपादुक = औपपादुक
{@upapāduka = aupapāduka@}¦, q.v.; used in exactly
the same ways, often in the same texts which elsewhere
use aup°, and by me grouped under the occurrences of
that form; note esp. Av ii.89.1 aupapādukaḥ as title of
the story, but in the text itself always upa°, ii.94.17 ff.;
other occurrences of upa° are Mvy 2282; Mv i.212.7;
Dharmas 90; Mmk 16.14; Gv 254.12; 264.24; 339.4;
SP 205.14; 455.4; Mv i.145.4; Divy 533.25; Śikṣ 175.8.
In some the v.l. aupa° is recorded.
