{@subhati@}¦ (= Pali sumbhati, Ved. subh-, see BR; cf.
{@paṭi-, vi-su°@}), {%smites%}: (āyasāsu ca droṇīṣu…) subhanti
(mss. here sutanti) pratyamitrāṇi Mv i.14.2 (vs); line
repeated with subh° 12; in 18.7 (prose) Senart em. subhassū
(for subhasva) ti, but the em. is remote from the corrupt
mss. and seems implausible.
