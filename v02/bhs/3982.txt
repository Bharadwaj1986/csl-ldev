{@ūrmi@}¦, m. or f. (in this sense AMg. ummi, see Ratnach.,
but not Skt. ūrmi, Pali ūmi, ummi), {%crowd, throng%} (of
creatures): Mv i.222.14 = ii.24.22 samantormijātā, {%form-%}
{%ing a crowd all around%} (here of gods); LV 173.13 (vs)
naṭaraṅgasamā jagi-r-ūrmi-cuti, {%like an actor's stage-set is%}
{%the passing of the crowd%} (of people) {%in the world%}; so if Lefm.'s
text is right, but v.l. janmi for r-ūrmi, which (or rather
janma) seems supported by Tib. skye.
