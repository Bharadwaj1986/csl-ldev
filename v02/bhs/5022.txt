{@kulala@}¦, m. (n. pl. °lā; = Pali id.), some bird of prey,
associated with gṛdhra and kāka (as in Pali with gijjha
and kāka): Mv i.7.4 °lā ca gṛdhrā ca kākolūkā ca; 11.11.
One might identify it with Skt. and Pali kurara, {%osprey%};
but the latter is not used in Pali in close association with
gijjha and kāka. In AMg. defined as a {%vulture%}, or
(another) {%kind of bird%}.
