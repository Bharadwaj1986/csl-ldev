{@anāpatti@}¦, f. (noun, = Pali id.; neg. of {@āpatti@}, q.v.)
{%no offense; unpunishableness%}: Divy 330.1 (read with mss.
anāpattis, or °ttiḥ, followed by punctuation: {%there is no%}
{%offense%}); similarly 544.17, 19; Śikṣ 11.8; anāpattiḥ kṣiptace-
tasaḥ, °ttiḥ śuddhāśayabhūmipraviṣṭasya Bbh 160.27;
ŚsP 56.5 (see s.v. {@anadhyāpatti@}). The Index to Divy
renders {%guiltless%}, as if Bhvr., but wrongly; as in Pali, the
word is always a Karmadh.
