{@pragharati@}¦ (praggh°? below; see {@gharati@}; Pali
paggharati, which because of the double ggh is customarily
associated with Skt. kṣar-, Geiger 56.2; even Skt., and still
more BHS, has forms which at least look as if they came
from a root ghṛ-, ghar-, see Wh. Roots and BR; cf. also
{@parighareti@}), {%flows forth%}: °ti Mvy 6967 (here v.l. praggha-
rati, and so Mironov; the only trace in BHS tradition of
the double ggh); Divy 57.21; 409.1; Śikṣ 249.7; Av i.202.13;
Karmav 66.4. See also {@prākharati (pra°?)@}. It may be,
perhaps, that the BHS forms of ghar- (not in Pali) origin-
ated as simplex back-formations from MIndic paggharati,
and that pragharati (instead of praggh°) was influenced
by gharati.How are the Skt. forms to be interpreted?
Uhlenbeck connects them with ghṛta, {%ghee%}.
