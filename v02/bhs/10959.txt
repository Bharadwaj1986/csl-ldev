{@biliśa@}¦ (so once in Skt. for regular baḍiśa, Suparṇ.,
pw 4.226; and note Pkt. biḍisa, Sheth; Pali only baḷisa,
bal°), {%fishhook%}; some form or cpd. of this word is to be
read in Mv iii.259.2, for mss. bilaśa (v.l. billaśa)-tāni-
kāyetsuḥ, and 260.16 (vs), same reading, except that
both mss. read billa° here; evidently a verb is concealed
in the end; Senart reads pāṭensuḥ, and before it bila-
śatāni, which is impossible. It is possible that bilaśa-
(with one ms.) is the true reading, tho it is not recorded
anywhere. The phrase follows, both times, that containing
{@kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@} (or {@kārṣāpaṇa°@}), q.v., while in
Pali lists of tortures kahāpaṇakaṃ regularly follows balisa-
maṃsikaṃ. It is certain that we must understand some
torture by means of {%fishhooks%}; should we read biliśa-tāṃ,
{%fishhook-condition%}, i.e. being torn with fishhooks? The
preceding words are much like those quoted as occurring
before {@kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@}.
