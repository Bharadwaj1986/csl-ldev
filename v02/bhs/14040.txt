{@vibhūṣitā, (1)@}¦ (? to Skt. vibhūṣin plus -tā), {%magni-%}
{%ficence, splendor, ornate condition%}: na śraddadhī mahyam
imāṃ vibhūṣitāṃ SP 113.10 (vs), {%he has not believed, ‘this%}
{%magnificence is mine’%}; no v.l. in KN; WT cite ms. Ḱ as
vibhūṣāṃ (Skt.), which they em. to vibhūtāṃ, implausibly;
Tib. ḥbyor ba (read pa), {%wealth, treasure%}; vibhūṣāṃ of Ḱ
looks like a secondary change, to a familiar Skt. word;
all the other three pādas of the stanza are jagatī (sup-
porting °ṣitāṃ); the same form prob. occurs in prose in:
tāṃ divyāṃ vibhūṣitāṃ (ms. °tān, mere orthographic var.)
dṛṣṭvā Av i.68.4, {%having seen this magnificence%} (Speyer em.
to °ṣikāṃ, which is unrecorded and implausible); ({@2@}) (ppp.
of vi-bhūṣ-) n. of an apsaras: Kv 3.10.
