<L>7586<pc>273,1<k1>द्राव<k2>द्राव
{@? drāva@}¦, nt. (vv.11. drāṣa, naṣa), some part of the
body, in a passage (vss, tho printed as prose) identifying
various bodily parts with features of the outside world:
(sāgaraś cāpy amedhyaṃ vai) drāvaṃ Brahmā Prajāpatiḥ
Divy 628.29. I have no idea what is intended; but sarvaṃ,
conjectured in note, seems implausible.
