{@Varakalyāṇa@}¦ (= Pali id.), n. of a king, son of {@Ka-@}
{@lyāṇa@}, q.v., and father of {@Upoṣadha@}, q.v. In Mv i.348.8
text is corrupt; the form {@Rava@} (v.l. Rāva) prob. represents
Vara(-kalyāṇa), but in one ms. seems also confused with
{@Roca@}, q.v., who should have been named earlier in the list.
