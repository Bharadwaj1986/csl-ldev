{@? utacchiyam@}¦, Ud xviii.22, is prob. a mere corrup-
tion: yo rāgam utacchiyam aśeṣaṃ = Pali Sn 2, yo
rāgam udacchidā asesaṃ, {%who has cut off passion without%}
{%remainder%}. If a substitute for ud-acchidat is intended
(which should end in a long syllable; °yaṃ?), it would
seem to show t for d (by hyper-Sktism? § 2.29) and y
for the second d (Pktic). I do not understand Chakravarti's
note.
