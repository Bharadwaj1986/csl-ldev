{@sama-tīrthika@}¦, f. {@°ikā@}, adj. (var. °thaka, °tittika;
Pali °titthika, var. °tittika, see below), {%full to the brim%};
in both Pali and BHS used ({@1@}) of rivers in flood (so most
commonly in Pali, e.g. DN i.244.14, where text °tittikā,
v.l. °titthikā, comm. ii.402.23 glosses samabharitā):
(gaṅgā…suparipūrṇā) samatīrthakā (read with v.l. and
Calc. °thikā) LV 407.2 (prose), Tib. mu daṅ mñam pa,
{%level with the borders (banks)%}; ({@2@}) of bowls of food: samatīr-
thikāṃ (sc. pātrīṃ) pūriṣu bhojanena LV 387.3 (vs), Tib.
zhal zas kyis ni ({%with food%}) kha da ({%to the brim%}) chad du
(read tshad du ? {%to full measure%}) bkaṅ ({%filled%}); na samatīr-
thikam Mvy 8565, (monks should) {%not%} (accept food) {%up%}
{%to the brim%} (of the bowl); Tib. mu daṅ kha daṅ…, cf.
above; var. °tittikam, which Mironov prints; Pali parallel,
Vin. iv.190.35, samatitthikaṃ piṇḍapātaṃ paṭiggahessāmi,
{%I shall accept almsfood%} (only) {%to the brim%} (of the bowl, not
heaped up higher). Acc. to Childers' informant, this is the
true reading and interpretation; for others see PTSD s.v.
The variant °tittika, tho found in both Pali and Mvy
tradition, is prob. a corruption. The mg. of tīrtha here
implied is an extension of Skt. usage, where it is used of
what are now called {%bathing ghats%} in India; from this to
{%edge, bank%}, of a river, was a short step; the cpd. sama-
tīrthika was prob. used first of very full rivers, then by
extension of food-bowls.
