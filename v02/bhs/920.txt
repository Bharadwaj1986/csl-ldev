<L>920<pc>031,1<k1>अनुप्रणिधेति<k2>अनु-प्रणिधेति
{@anu-praṇidheti@}¦ (not in Pali), = {@praṇidheti@}, {%makes%}
{%a vow%} (to persist towards enlightenment); °dheti Mv
i.119.15; °dhemi (mss. anuparidehi) 323.1; °dhesi, aor.,
335.11; °hitaṃ, ppp., i.63.3. See {@anupraṇidhi@}, which is
commoner than the verb. If there is any difference be-
tween this and praṇi° without anu, it does not appear
clearly; anu does not necessarily imply {%after%} (a gift or
meritorious act), tho this often precedes; in Mv i.323.1
however none is mentioned.
