{@kuṭṭana@}¦ (m. or nt.), in ayo-kuṭṭanehi kuṭṭīyantā Mv
i.6.5 (prose), {%being pounded with iron hammers%}. Cf. Pali
ayo-kūṭa, and Skt. kūṭa, {%iron hammer%} (once, Mbh.); the
word kuṭṭana is found in Skt. as noun of action, {%pounding%}
(cf. kuṭṭ-ayati); our form looks like an etymological
blending, with influence of the ‘Morengesetz’ (§ 3.4a).
