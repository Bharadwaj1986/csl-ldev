{@antara-kalpa@}¦, m. (= Pali °kappa), {%internal%} (sub-
division of a) {%kalpa%} or {%aeon%}, or {%intermediate kalpa%} (period
between major kalpas). In AbhidhK. iii.181 the var.
antaḥkalpa is recorded, along with this; it seems to point
to the first definition above, and La Vallée Poussin, ad
loc., considers this the only correct definition; there are
80 in a mahākalpa, op. cit. 187 (in Pali 64, CPD). On the
other hand Mvy 8281 renders antara-(kalpa) by Tib. bar
gyi, {%intermediate%}, and similarly śastrāntara-, rogāntara-,
durbhikṣāntara-k° 8282--4; these suggest that antara-
kalpas are periods of destruction or disaster for people,
cf. CPD s.v. °kappa, {%a%} (short) {%intermediate period%} (of
destruction of mankind). CPD recognizes both the above
meanings, and this seems provisionally probable. It is
often not clear which appears in specific cases; in Gv
325.15 perhaps the second: dvādaśānām antarakalpānām
atyayena SP 67.1; prabhāṣate taj jina agradharmān…
antarakalpaṣaṣṭim SP 25.8; cf. Dharmas 87 (see s.v.
{@kalpa@} 4); SP 159.3 ff.; Mmk 295.9 (°paṃ jīvati). In SP
68.10 text manujānam abhyantara-kalpa (= antara°),
but prob. read °jān’ apī antara° (see WT).
