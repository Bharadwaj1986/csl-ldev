{@mānavaka@}¦ (sometimes written for Skt. māṇavaka,
as LV 101.9 and 108.5, all mss.; f. mānavikānāṃ, perh.
rather to Skt. mānava, mānavī, {%human being%}, Mv ii.432.4,
used of king's wives), m. or nt., in Av i.265.7 is, or corruptly
represents, a word meaning {%peg, post%}, or the like, for hanging
clothes: yena…sā {@yamalī@} (q.v.) krītā, tena mānavake
sthāpitā Av i.265.7; Tib. cited by Speyer as gdaṅ, which
(or gdaṅ bu, Mvy 9037) = {@carpaṭaka@}, q.v. The context
proves that this is approximately right in mg. But Speyer's
suggestion that we em. tenārambhaṇake (should be
°mbaṇake, see {@ārambaṇaka@}) is improbable; that word
seems to mean a different kind of {%peg%}, tho also rendered
by Tib. gdaṅ (bu). Could our word be related to AMg.
māṇavaya, n. of a divine ‘caitya-stambha’ (see Ratnach.
s.v.)?
