[{@pakṣati:@}¦ °nti in LV 88.15, if correct could only be
a denom. from pakṣa, {%party%}; cf. Dhātup. pakṣa(ya)ti =
parigrahe; with object pratipakṣaṃ, {%adhere to the opposite%}
{%party%}. But several mss. vakṣanti, which could intend
vakṣyanti, as read by Calc., and this seems supported by
Tib. brjod pa, {%speak%}; prob. therefore read so.]
