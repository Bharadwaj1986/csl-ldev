{@? parikuddāleti@}¦, so Senart's note for his text pari-
kuḍḍāleti; he assumes pari plus denom. from Skt. kuddāla,
{%hoes or spades around%} (a tree): Mv iii.301.16, see {@parikīleti@}.
But the mss. read °kudeti or °kūḍyeti, which looks more
like a denom. from kuḍya (Lex. also kūḍya), {%wall%}; perhaps
{%walls about ?%}
