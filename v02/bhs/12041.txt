{@mālā-vihāra@}¦, m., acc. to Tib. (on Śikṣ) phreṅ baḥi
khaṅ, {%garland-building%}: Mv ii.367.3 (vs, = Śikṣ 300.8) °raṃ
kṛtvāna (Śikṣ kṛtvā ca) lokanāthasya dhātuṣu, constructed
at a place where relics of Buddha are kept. But Lévi,
Karmav 63 n. 2, argues, perhaps rightly, that mālā here
means not {%garland%} but {%pavilion%} (on top of a building);
see {@mālā@}; he finds the same word in the Bhvr. candana-
māla, see {@-māla@}.
