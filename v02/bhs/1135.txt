{@antarā-parinirvāyin@}¦, adj. (= Pali °nibbāyī), acc.
to Tib. on Mvy 1015 (bar ma dor, for antarā) {%attaining%}
{%nirvāṇa in the intermediate state%} (between death and re-
birth; i.e. before the soul can be reborn in a new existence);
Dharmas 103; Mv i.33.6. Acc. to CPD, rather {%entering%}
{%nirvāṇa before the term%}, i.e. {%before having passed the first%}
{%half of life%} (in the middle of life). This seems to be the
orthodox Pali interpretation, but the Tib. interpretation
was also known (cf. CPD s.v. antarābhava); it is refuted
in Kathāvatthu viii.2 (Transl. pp. 212--3).
