{@kṣamaṇīya@}¦, adj. or subst. nt. (= Pali khamanīya,
Vin. i.59.10, also with yāpanīya), {%tolerable, endurable%}
(condition): SP 429.4, see s.v. {@yāpanīya@}. Both this form
and {@kṣemaṇīya(-tara@}, q.v.) are used in what is clearly
the same locution, bracketed with yāpanīya; kṣam° is
supported by Pali khamanīya, but {@kṣemaṇīya-pṛccha@},
q.v., supports kṣem°. Etymologically both forms can be
justified in a way, but kṣemaṇīya looks strange as a
derivative of kṣema (premaṇīya is not a perfect parallel)
and may be a blend of kṣamaṇīya with kṣema. Or is it
a direct imitation of {@premaṇīya@}, a near-synonym?
