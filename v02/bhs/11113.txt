{@? bhaṅgakula@}¦, Mv ii.251.6, in a list of enemies of
birds, all gen. pl., after sākuntikānām (śā°), cāṇḍālakānām
(mss. ca°), mṛgalubdhakānām, biḍālakroṣṭukānām, and
nakulānām, comes (in text) bhaṅgakulānām (but mss.
both °kulān; one ms. bhaṅgeṇa--so, ṇ!--for bhaṅga-).
Senart thinks of muṅgusa-kulānām (Pali Lex. muṅgusa,
{%mongoose%}, Childers); closer to the mss. would be AMg.
maṅgusa, id. As Senart notes, this would seem to duplicate
nakulānām, the preceding term. Possibly, however,
maṅgusānām may have been the orig. reading, the last
part corrupted by confusion with nakula. It might,
possibly, have designated a different species of {%mongoose%}
from nakula, which would justify the collocation of the
two words.
