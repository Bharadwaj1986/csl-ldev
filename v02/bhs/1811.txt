{@Amitābha, (1)@}¦ n. of the Buddha who presides over
the western paradise {@Sukhāvatī@} (lokadhātu); also known
as {@Amitāyu(s), Amitaprabha, Amitanātha@}, and doubt-
less intended by the Mmk names {@Amitāyu(rjñāna)-@}
{@viniścayarājendra@} (or the like), even tho he is once
depicted separately in a painting centering about that
personage (Mmk 305.12--13, cf. 304.25). See these names
separately. The two commonest names are Amitābha and
Amitāyus, and they are as a rule quite equivalent and
interchangeable; see notably Sukh 62.13--14; 95.15 and 20.
Often Sukhāvatī is mentioned with him. He is the fourth
of the ‘transcendent’ Buddhas, Dharmas 3; Mvy 85. Other
occurrences: Suv 2.5; Bhad 49, 57, 59, 62; Śikṣ 175.6;
Kv 18.7; 21.8 etc.; Mmk 42.16; 426.7; Gv 82.5; Laṅk
283.7; Sukh 1.6; 28.10 etc.; Sādh 16.10 etc.; ({@2@}) n. of a
Bodhisattva: Gv 442.22 (one of a long list, and hardly
to be identified with the Buddha A.).
