{@samudghāṭayati@}¦, {%removes, abolishes, destroys%}: kle-
śānuśayāḥ °ṭayitavyāḥ Gv 458.11; cf. {@°ghaṭana@}. Skt. has
udghaṭati, {%opens%} (intr.), and (sam-)udghāṭayati, {%opens%}
(trans.); in this meaning BHS {@°ghāṭana@}; it seems that all
the other related words ({@°ghaṭana@} etc. thru {@°ghāṭin@})
have the mg. appropriate to {@samudghāta@} and its sept,
which is paralleled in Pali.In BHS, but only here so far
as recorded, confusion has occurred between derivs. of
(sam-ud-)ghaṭ- and han- (caus.).
