{@? busaplāvī@}¦, acc. sg. °vīm, something disagreeable
(hard, or foul, offensive) to eat; parallel with ayoguḍa,
svamāṃsa, pūyaśoṇita: Divy 12.25; 13.17; all things
which niggards wished a mendicant should eat, and which
later they were therefore obliged to eat themselves. The
Index renders {%beetle%} (?); I do not know why. The first
member seems to be Skt. busa, {%chaff, refuse, rubbish%}; perh.
the ed. of Divy understood the latter part as {%leaping%} ({%in%}
{%chaff%} of grain; even this need not lead to the mg. {%beetle%}).
Same passage MSV iv.176.7; 177.11; Tib. cited as phub
ma, {%chaff%} (= busa), for the entire word.
