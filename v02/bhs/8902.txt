{@para-praṇeya@}¦, {%needing to be guided by others%} (on
account of blindness): Mv ii.212.4 (prose) and 214.4 (prose),
Senart both times °prāṇeya (with both mss. 212.4 and
one 214.4, also v.l. 221.2), interpreted as {%whose life%} (prāṇa)
{%depends on others%}; 221.2 (vs) °praṇeyeṣu (Senart em.
°yyeṣu), here short a in °praṇ° is required by meter; that
Senart's theory is incorrect seems to me proved by 218.3
where the persons in question say that, being blind, they
cannot go anywhere vinā praṇetareṇa, {%without a guide%}.
