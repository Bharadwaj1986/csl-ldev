1 {@pratyuddhārya@}¦, adj. (gdve. to °dharati, or adj. to
°dhāra), in a-pra°, {%that is not to be restored or taken back%}:
apratyuddhāryam asya (Bhīk asyā) bhavati śrāmaṇyam
Mvy 9133; Bhīk 23b.5, {%not to be restored is his monkhood%}
{%(her nunhood)%}, of a person permanently expelled; a-
pratyuddhārya-paribhogaḥ Mvy 8493, {%use of%} (a gift once
given or promised) {%which ought not to be taken back%}; so
Tib. phyir ma blaṅs (or slaṅs, a form of which is used in
Tib. version of 9133 above) par spyod pa; Chin. {%using%}
{%again after giving trickily%}. The form in °-rya-might perhaps
be interpreted as a gerund, see next; it is certainly so used
in Prāt 519.5; but the corresp. Pali, Vin. iv. 121.16, 19, 22,
31; 122.17 ff., has an adj. apaccuddhāraka (and in 122.21 ff.
paccuddhāraka), which means {%that ought not (ought) to be%}
{%taken back%}; applied to a monk's robe, as in Prāt; mis-
interpreted even in CPD. The old Vin. comm., iv. 122.19-25,
makes my interpretation unmistakably clear; note especi-
ally 24 paccuddhārake paccuddhārakasaññī, anāpatti,
{%there is no offense in the case of a thing that may%} (properly)
{%be resumed, when%} (the one who so acts) {%knows that it is%};
cf. 17-18 which explains the circumstances under which
it is apaccuddhāraka (implying that it is paccud° in other
cases).
