[{@āśu:@}¦ Johnston, notes on Saundarān. vi.9 and Buddhac.
vi.64, assumes use as ‘expletive’, ‘to strengthen the force
of the verb,’ ‘in epic and Buddhist Skt.,’ and suggests
relation to the Pali particle assu. He so interprets āśu
in Manu 4.171. I disagree on all this; it seems to me that
there is no reason to assume any āśu except the adj. and
adverb, {%quick(ly)%}. Tib. renders {%quickly%} at Buddhac. vi.64.]
