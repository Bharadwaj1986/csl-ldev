{@kathatva@}¦ (nt.; to katham, with -tva; cf. Skt. ka-
thaṃtā, rare), {%how-ness, manner%}: Gv 526.23 (prose)
dharmadhātu-prakṛti-kathatvāyatana-m-ucitatvān na
kṣaṇyante sarvaviṣayeṣu (bodhisattvāḥ); -ucitatvān can
only be construed as part of preceding cpd. (m. ‘Hiatus-
bridger’); the text seems rather suspicious.
