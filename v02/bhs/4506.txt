<L>4506<pc>169,2<k1>करिय<k2>करिय
{@kariya@}¦ (nt.), MIndic for Skt. kārya, {%deed%}: iti-pra-
mukhā kariyā (n.-acc. pl.) LV 168.1, 10; 169.4 (vss).
The shortening of ā to a is regular enough, § 3.103, but
this form seems, as far as I can find, not to be recorded
in the MIndic Dictt.; and it may be only m.c. in this
phrase.
