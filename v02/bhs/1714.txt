<L>1714<pc>060,1<k1>अभौति<k2>अभौति-
{@? abhauti-@}¦, in Laṅk 17.5, text abhauti-bhautikānām;
Suzuki {%things created and uncreated%}; the mss. are very
confused; some simply abhautikānāṃ; perhaps read
[Page060-b+ 71]
abhautika-bhaut° (and perhaps render rather {%of things%}
{%non-elemental and elemental%}). Surely no stem abhauti
should be recognized. See {@bhautika@} (2); one possible
reading for the above passage might be bhūta-bhauti-
kānām, {%of gross elements and%} (subsidiary elements or)
{%sense-objects%}.
