<L>251<pc>008,1<k1>अञ्ज<k2>अञ्ज (अञ्जस्
[{@añja (añjas?)@}¦, cf. Skt. añjas, {%quickly%}; exclamation
used in Pali (Jāt. i.192.5, 29) in urging a draft-animal to go
{%(gee! get up! go ahead!), come up!%} In LV 394.18 (vs) tad
añja is Lefm.'s em. for tad-anya of all mss. and Calc.
which seems to make no sense. Addressed by Brahmā to
the Buddha, urging him to preach the law; presumed to
mean perhaps {%come on!%} But Tib. seems to have had a
quite different reading: kha ḥbyed pa, {%mouth open%} (Fou-
caux, {%ouvre ta bouche%}; but the form is not given as impv.
by Jä). Should we read {@ud-añca@}, 2 sg. impv., for Skt.
ud-añcaya, {%ertönen lassen%} (pw)? Graphic confusion of {%u%}
and {%ta%} occurs in some Indian alphabets, e.g. in Śāradā.]
