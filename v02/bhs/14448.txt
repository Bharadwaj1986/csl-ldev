{@vedanā@}¦, rarely {@°na@} (Pali only °nā recorded, so usually
in Skt. in this mg. but rarely °na), {%feeling, sensation%}: as
in Pali there are three, e.g. Mvy 1913, listed 1914--6 as
sukhāḥ, duḥkhāḥ, aduḥkhāsukhāḥ; these are correlated in
Śikṣ 232.11 ff. with rāga (for sukha), dveṣa (also {@doṣa@},
for duḥkha), and moha (in regard to aduḥkhāsukha), all
of course to be abandoned; sarva-°nāsu vītarāgo (mss.
tīvra-rāgo; Senart em. with Pali Sn 529) Mv iii.397.19
(vs); vedanā is the 7th link in the {@pratītyasamutpāda@},
q.v. (cf. e.g. sparśena tisra anuvartati vedanā ca LV
420.2, vs, in pra°sam°); it is also the 2d of the 5 {@skandha@},
q.v. and the 2d of the 4 {@smṛtyupasthāna@}, q.v. (Śikṣ
232.6 ff. discusses it in this connection); as nt., vedako
vedanād anyaḥ pṛthagbhūto na vidyate Śikṣ 233.11 (vs).
