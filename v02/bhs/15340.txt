[{@śleṣmika@}¦, adj., = Skt. ślaiṣmika, (disease) {%due to%}
(disturbance of) {%phlegm%}: kathaṃ cikitsā kartavyā vāte
pitte śleṣmike tathā Suv 177.10 (vs), so Nobel. But the
meter is bad, and I think we should read vātike paittike
tathā for the 2d pāda, with best ms. except that it reads
yettike for pai°. Diseases of phlegm were, in the orig.
reading, mentioned in the 2d pāda of the next line, where,
contrary to Nobel, I would read with 2 mss., incl. the best,
kaphavyādhipraśāntaye (v.l. kaphaja-vyā°). The four
pādas then present the same four topics, and in the same
order, as in 179.7--10 below.]
