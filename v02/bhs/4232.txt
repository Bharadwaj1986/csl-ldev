{@? oruṇḍa@}¦, adj., perhaps for ava-ruṇḍa = ruṇḍa,
{%mutilated%} (cf. {@ava-kubja, ava-koṭimaka@}): LV 333.16 (vs)
chinna-kara-caraṇa ivoruṇḍaḥ, {%mutilated, as if having%}
{%hands and feet cut off%}. But possibly understand ivo (m.c.
for iva, § 3.82) ruṇḍaḥ; in a verse, the meter of which
is MIndic and obscure to me.
