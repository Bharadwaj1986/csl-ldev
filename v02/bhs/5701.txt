{@gahana@}¦ (nt., or adj.), is sometimes, apparently, in-
volved in word-plays with {@grahaṇa@}, q.v. (on the basis of
MIndic pronunciation of the latter). In Śikṣ 286.1 (aśaṭhatā
śaṭheṣu,) amāyāvitā gahanacariteṣu (this is the clear
intention of the ms., see ed. note, and must be read),
kṛtajñatā akṛtajñeṣu, etc., the Tib. is said to render
{%guilelessness among the guileful%}, which is supported by the
parallel phrases surrounding this. The transl. of Bendall
and Rouse renders gahana-carita {%overreaching%}; it seems
more likely to mean {%of obscure, hidden%} (or perhaps {%tangled%})
{%conduct%}, and so {%tricky%}. See next (apparently a quite un-
related confusion).
