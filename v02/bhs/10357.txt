rūkṣapradhānaprahitātmakatvāt LV 256.6 (prose); the

(vs), {%my horses are the four right exertions%}, for which see
also (samyak)prahāṇa; cf. Pali sammappadhāna; the four
(cited in Childers and PTSD) are, exertion to prevent
sinful states (dhamma = dharma) from arising, to get
rid of those that exist, to produce good states, and to
maintain those already existing; for BHS definitions
(agreeing with this) see prahāṇa. In AbhidhK. LaV-P.
vi.281, Vyākhyā, four samyakpradhāna; the older Chin.
rendering has {%effort%}, the later {%abandonment%}, as if (Skt.)
prahāṇa; Tib. also the latter.
