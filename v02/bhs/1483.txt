{@abhitunna@}¦, and {@abhitūrṇa@} (= Pali abhitunna, also
written °ṇṇa; etym., see below), {%afflicted%}: Mv i.156.10 (vs)
tasya…vacābhitunno…rudanto (subject Chandaka:
{%afflicted by his words%}); iii.284.13 śokābhitunna (so Pali
sokābhi°). The form abhitūrṇa is read by KN in SP 320.9
duḥkhābhir vedanābhir abhi°, with Kashgar rec.; in 321.3
Kashgar rec. also vedanābhitūrṇān, but KN this time
°bhibhūtān. Kern cites Pāṇ. 6.4.21 for tūrṇa (not recorded
in literature) as ppp. of turvati, {%overcomes%}. Neither this
root nor tud is recorded with abhi, except for the Pali
form cited, which CPD derives from tud, but Kern (see
PTSD) from turv, doubtless because of BHS abhitūrṇa.
The BHS °tunna could be a MIndicism; but contrariwise,
perhaps, °tūrṇa could be an unhistoric hyper-Sktism. All
that seems certain is that the two belong together and with
Pali abhitunna.
