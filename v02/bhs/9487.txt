{@-pāsa(ka)@}¦, f. {@-ikā@}, ifc. (Pali sūci-pāsa, Vism. 284.14),
{%eye (of a needle)%}, in {@vaṭṭa-p°@}, q.v., Mv ii.87.17; text
°yāsikā; same vs in Pali, Jāt. iii.282.13, su-pāsiyaṃ (v.l.
°kaṃ), acc. sg. with sūciṃ; comm. sundarena suviddhena
pāsena samannāgatattā supāsiyaṃ (suggesting that -iya
or -ka, -ikā, accompanies the Bhvr. cpd. only); and, in
fact, pāse (loc.) occurs in the prose iii.282.3, 5, with
vijjhi(tvā), where the translators render wrongly {%dice%};
rather, {%piercing%} (the needle) {%at the%} (place for the) {%eye%}.
From Skt. pāśa, {%loop ?%} A Deśī word (Deśīn. 6.75) pāsa =
akṣi, {%eye%}, is recorded. Hindi āṅkh, {%eye%}, is given the meaning
{%hole of a needle%} (sūī kā ched) in Hindī Śabdasāgara (1914),
1 p. 312, s.v. āṅkh, mg. 4; I have found no confirmation
of this, or of any use of a word for {%eye%}, of a {%needle's eye%},
in any Indian dialect, in any other source. The Hindi
usage (evidently limited) could possibly be explained as
due to English influence. Professor W.N. Brown informs
me that the common Hindi word for {%eye of a needle%} is
nākā. However, Jä. says that Tib. mig, regularly {%eye%},
also means {%eye of a needle%}, and {%hole for the handle%} of a
hatchet etc.
