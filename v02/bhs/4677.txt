{@? Kācī@}¦, pl., adopted by Lévi Māy 68 (Kācīṣu, loc.)
as n. of a people or region, but apparently by his own em.;
if I understand him, all his mss. and Chin. and Tib. transl.
vary ({@Kāca@}, Kāśī, Kāñcī, etc.). Since this form seems un-
recorded, it would seem better to have adopted some form
supported by at least one authority.
