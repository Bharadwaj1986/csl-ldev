{@udyūthikā@}¦, f. subst. (adj.?), (cf. Pali uyyodhika, Vin.
iv.107.26, old comm. = yattha saṃpahāro dissati, the
correspondent of our word, which seems to have been
Sktized by association with yūtha, prob. unhistorically;
root yudh is doubtless the true source; but mg. is rather
obscure, see Childers, who guesses {%sham fight%}), perhaps
some sort of military exercise, such as {%sham battle%}; in
Mvy 8470 °kā-gamanam = Tib. gyul bśams pa ḥkhrug
tu (ḥgro ba), (going to) {%an army prepared for battle?%} or
{%a battle-prepared combat%} (i.e. a military maneuver)?;
in Prāt 512.6 seemingly adj. with senā, udyūthikāṃ
senāṃ darśanāya (Chin. {%regarder les manœuvres%}, Finot);
in accord with this possibly udyūthikā in Mvy may imply
senā, meaning (an army) {%ready for military operations%} (?).
