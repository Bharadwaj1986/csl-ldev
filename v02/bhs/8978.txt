{@? parigohya@}¦, in Mv i.196.2 tripauruṣa-parigohyāni,
is or represents a word meaning {%circumference%} (epithet of
iṣikāni, so ed., see {@iṣika@}); mss. corrupt, see Senart's note.
The same word, whatever it was, should surely be read
as final member of the word read by Senart tripauruṣoc-
cāni iii.228.13 (see s.v. {@udvedha@}).
