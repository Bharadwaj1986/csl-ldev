<L>1206<pc>042,1<k1>अन्यवाद<k2>अन्यवाद-
{@anyavāda-@}¦ (m. ?; cf. Pali aññavādaka, adj. and n.
nt.), {%talking about something else, shuffling and evading the%}
{%question%} (CPD); in anyavāda-viheṭhana, nt., (a monk's)
{%causing annoyance%} (to the community) {%by doing this%}, v.l.
in Kyoto ed. of Mvy for 8433, text ājñā-viheṭhanam (so
Mironov without v.l.; Tib., Chin. and Jap. {%violation of%}
{%commands%}; for the v.l. the Jap. editor gives the correct
interpretation, as above); Prāt 505.1, text anyā-vāda
(-viheṭhanāt), which Finot would em. to anya°; Chin
‘si un bhikṣu ennuie les autres en donnant des réponses
à côté’ (= anya°). The corresp. Pali, Vin. iv. 36.3, 18, 37
etc., has añña-vādaka, which certainly means what is
stated above (the context proves it clearly). Mvy ājñā-
(-vāda) is evidently an ignorant and secondary hyper-
Sktism, based on a MIndic form of anya-interpreted as
= ājñā- (cf. § 2.15). It is, however, very curious that the
text of Prāt reads anyā-with long stem-final ā!
