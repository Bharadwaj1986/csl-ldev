{@phaleṣin@}¦, adj. (Skt. phala plus -eṣin; = Pali °sin,
in same vs as Mv, Therag. 527 = Jāt. i.87.2), {%seeking%} (to
bring forth) {%fruit%}, ep. of trees, acc. to Pali: (read) °ṣiṇo
Mv iii.93.11. The Mv is very corrupt and has omitted the
word for {%tree%} (drumāḥ, Pali dumā), but there is no doubt
that the text was substantially the same; Senart with
mss. s for ṣ, but one ms. has ṇ for (Senart's) n!
