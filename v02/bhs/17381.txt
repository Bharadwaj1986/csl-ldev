{@? stemita@}¦, text Lefm. LV 230.9 (vs), could only =
Skt. stimita (m.c.? cf. abstr. staimitya), {%motionless%}, i.e.
{%insensible, fainting%}: (of Śuddhodana on hearing of his
son's departure; in 7--8 dharaṇitale nirasto utkrośu
kṛtvā…) so stemito (with only two inferior mss., others
with Calc. stomito) hī jalaghaṭasaṃprasikto, āśvāsayantī
bahuśata Śākiyānāṃ; Lefm. cites Tib. from Foucaux's
transl. {%sanglotait%}, but this (ṅud mo phyuṅ) = utkrośu
kṛtvā, and is put in prec. line; for line 9 Tib. de nas ({%then%})
de la ({%on him%}) bum paḥi chu blugs khrus byas nas (lit.
{%of-flask-water-pitcher-after-bathing%}), with nothing that seems
to render stemito; I can make nothing of stomito; de nas
could point to ito, and I suspect a corruption in the first
part of the word.
