{@muṣṭi-bandha, -saṃbandha@}¦, m., a particular
technique of {%grasping%} (the bow) {%with the fist%} (see s.v.
{@muṣṭi@}); several times muṣṭi-b° is mentioned in a list of
arts to be mastered by a prince: Mvy 4978; LV 156.12;
Divy 100.12 and 442.7, along with {@pada-bandha@} or {@pāda°@},
and (in all but Divy 100.12) also {@śikhā-bandha@}; in both
Divy passages these words are directly followed by {@dūra-@}
{@vedha@}, which occurs not far away in Mvy (4991). That
[Page436-a+ 71]
a manner of wielding the bow is meant is suggested by
the context in all, and proved by Mv ii.82.17 muṣṭisaṃ-
bandho ca, yatra nāma vārāṇasyāṃ sthitena kāṇḍaṃ
kṣiptaṃ. Tib. on Mvy and LV ḥdzin staṅs, {%grasping%}
{%posture%}.
