{@? saṃgandharāja@}¦ (unrecorded); if = Skt. Lex.
gandharāja, could mean one of several flowers or flowering
plants, or sandalwood: Gv 337.2 (vs), read (tad vajra-
daṇḍaṃ…) saṃgandharājojjvalakesarāḍhyaṃ, as one
cpd.; sa-gan° would be metrically equally good, hence
saṃ- could not be m.c. for sa- (but may corruptly repre-
sent sa-).
