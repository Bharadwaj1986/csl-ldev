{@yathāpi, (1)@}¦ (in this sense unparalleled so far as I
know) alone, or esp. followed by idam ({@yathāpīdam@}),
also by tat, and rarely by nāma, {%because of course, because%}
{%obviously%}, in giving a (more or less evident) reason for what
has just been said: tat kasya hetoh? yathāpīdam bāla-
bhāvatvāt SP 73.11, {%and why? because, you see, of the fact%}
{%that they were (foolish) children%}; in same context, yathāpi
bālā(ḥ) SP 86.6 (vs); yathāpi…(without idaṃ or the
like) 90.4 (vs); yathāpi (so Kashgar rec.; Nep. tathāpi;
WT em. tathā hi, perh. supported by Tib. ḥdi ltar)
buddhena adhiṣṭhitatvāt 238.2 (vs), {%since, of course, they%}
{%are inspired by the Buddha%}; yathāpīdaṃ, in this same mg.,
SP 38.14; 110.10; 210.2; (tat kasya) hetoḥ? yathāpīdaṃ
sukhasthānasthitatvāt 283.2; yathāpīdaṃ rūkṣapradhā-
naṃ prahitātmanaḥ LV 255.3, {%of course because%} (there was)
{%harsh exertion%}; similarly, yathāpīdaṃ adṛṣṭapūrvaṃ
dṛśyate Mv iii.210.18, {%of course because a previously unseen%}
{%thing was seen%}; yathāpīdaṃ anuttare upadhisaṃkṣaye
samyaksuvimuktacitto Mv iii.282.6, {%because, of course, he%}
{%had his mind…%}; repeated 12; 283.2; and, only in 283.8,
otherwise same phrase and situation, {@sayyathāpīdaṃ@},
which is an otherwise unknown use of the form {@sayyathāpi@},
see under 2 below; in the same mg., more rarely, with
nāma for idam: tat kasya hetoḥ? yathāpi nāma vayaṃ
tathāgatasya bhūtāḥ putrā(ḥ) SP 110.4; yathāpi nāma…
[Page443-a+ 71]
Śikṣ 40.12; also with tat for idaṃ (or nāma): yathāpi tac
cittavaśavartitvād LV 244.22, {%of course because he was in%}
{%control of his thoughts%}; yathāpi tat (mss.; ed. wrongly
em. tataḥ) sphuṭo Māreṇa pāpīyasā (referring back to
same words in lines 21--22) Divy 201.23, {%of course (you%}
{%see) because…%}; yathāpi tad 230.16; MSV i.51.21; also
read in LV 256.6, with v.l. incl. best ms. A, (śubhavar-
ṇatanutā) sāpy antaradhād, yathāpi (Lefm. tad yathāpi,
but this tad should surely not be in the text) tad rūkṣapra-
dhāna-prahitātmakatvāt (cf. above, LV 255.3); ({@2@}) {@tad@}
{@yathāpi nāma@}, and (only Mv) {@sayyathāpi nāma@} (very
rarely the word nāma is omitted, Mv ii.124.12, in a clause
of comparison ending bhavati); mss. of Mv also {@tayyathā°,@}
{@sadyathā°; saṃyadhāpi nāma@} (! cf. {@saṃyathīdaṃ@})
balavān puruṣaḥ…bāhuṃ prasārayet Mmk 3.25 (=
Pali seyyathāpi, with or without nāma, very rarely
sayathāpi, Therag. 412; = Skt. tad yathā, also in Pali
as taṃ yathā; note Mv i.55.13 and 56.8 tad yathā, repeating
54.13 tad yathāpi nāma, balavān puruṣaḥ…, same clause
as in Mmk 3.25 above, a cliché in which Mv elsewhere has
sayyathāpi nāma), {%just as%} (followed by nominal phrase or
verbal clause), or {%just as if%} (followed by hypothetical
clause, or series of clauses, or, esp. in SP, by an entire
long parable, which may fill most of a chapter): sayyathāpi
(so Senart but mss. tayyathā° or tad yathā°) nāma kalam-
bukā ({%just like k's%}), evaṃ varṇapratibhāsāpi abhū Mv
i.341.5; in 7 below Senart with mss. tad yathāpi nāma
kṣudraṃ madhum anelakaṃ (or °ḍakaṃ, mss.), evam-
āsvādā; tad yathāpi nāma…etāni buddhakṣetrāṇi
saṃdṛśyante SP 20.10, {%just as these b° appear%}; tad yathāpi
nāma…udumbarapuṣpaṃ kadācit karhicit saṃdṛśyate,
evaṃ…SP 39.8, {%just as an ud° fruit rarely appears, so…%};
introducing rather long parables, SP 101.11; 121.11, etc.;
the range of usage is sufficiently indicated by these quota-
tions; tad yathāpi nāma very often, e.g. LV 246.17; 247.17;
251.9, 17; Mv i.194.13; 341.7; iii.229.3; 425.15, 21 (and in
mss. as v.l. for sayyathā°, below); both in one sentence,
(imasmiṃ ca pṛthivīyaṃ unmajjana-nimajjanaṃ karoti)
sayyathāpi nāma udake pi abhidyamāno (mss. °nā)
gacchati, tad yathāpi nāma pṛthivīyaṃ Mv iii.410.2, {%(he%}
{%plunges up and down in this earth,) just as if he were going%}
{%in water unbroken, just as if on land%} (awkwardly expressed,
but the mg. is certain in my opinion); tad yathāpi nāma,
also Sukh 19.16 et al.; Śikṣ 21.17 et al.; Gv 20.1 et al.;
Dbh 7.23; RP 40.1; in RP 40.20 and 42.1 read tad (for
text syād) yathāpi nāma; {@sayyathāpi nāma@}, only Mv,
often with vv.ll. tad ya° (not here recorded) and others,
i.339.8 (twice); 340.12, 13, 15; 345.12; ii.121.7; 124.5;
125.3, 12, 13, 16, etc.; ii.270.3 ff. (repeatedly, with v.l.
sadyathā°); 282.10; 313.16, 17; 412.8; iii.103.14, 17, 20;
108.7; 180.16; 181.7; 226.18; 282.8, 14; 283.5; 318.5;
325.16; 329.5, 13 (the last four corresp. to LV 400.3;
405.10; 408.8; 409.19, all reading tad yathā°); 379.16;
{@(3) sayyathāpi@}, very rarely (like Pali seyyathāpi, see
Childers 468, column 2, lines 10, 13, etc.) = {@sayyathīdaṃ@},
q.v., {%namely, to wit, viz%}.: (evaṃrūpehi) śabdehi, sayyathāpi
(no v.l.) hastiśabdehi rathaśabdehi (etc.) Mv i.196.12.
