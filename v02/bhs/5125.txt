1 {@-kṛtvā@}¦ (also -kṛtva, -kṛtvaṃ), for Skt. -kṛtvas,
adv.,…{%time(s)%}, after numerals in comp.; kṛtvā is the
only non-Skt. form noted outside of Mv, viz. in Suv
115.4; 116.7 (only v.l. triḥ° for triṣ-kṛtvā); Divy 95.24
and 124.20 ṣaṭkṛtvā (mss., ed. em. °tvo); Śikṣ 290.10, 12
triṣkṛtvā. In the mss. of Mv this form is found, along
with many others (partial list Senart, note on i.212.5);
Senart's text is highly arbitrary and inconsistent, paying
often little attention to the mss., but also not attempting
to standardize. In the following list the readings of the
mss. as given by Senart are cited. Forms showing u in
the penult of course are related to AMg. khutto, M.
huttaṃ (Pischel 451); those with final nasal, to the latter
and to Pali khattuṃ; the vowel u seems not to occur in
the final syllable except when preceded by a single t,
in which case -tu- is apparently only a misreading or
miswriting for -tta- (Senart, l.c.). Forms in -tya, -tyā,
tyo, -tyaṃ seem to be unparalleled in other dialects
but are quite common in Mv, which shows (in mss.) the
following: -kṛtvā, -kṛtva, -kṛtvaṃ, and very rarely -kṛto,
kṛtaṃ; -kṛtya, -kṛtyā, -kṛtyo, -kṛtyaṃ; -khuttaṃ (cf.
the Pkt. forms above), -khutta, -kṣuttaṃ (hyper-Skt.),
kṣunto; -khattaṃ (cf. Pali, above), -kṣattaṃ, -kṣatto,
kuttaṃ, and a few other readings too obviously corrupt
to be worth listing (but noted below): Mv (S = Senart's
