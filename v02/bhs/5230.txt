{@koṭṭa-rājan@}¦ or {@°rāja@}, lit. {%fort-ruler%}; precise mg. not
clear; sometimes clearly an independent potentate (tho
perhaps a minor one, cf. Mvy 3677 °rājā = Tib. khams
kyi rgyal po, {%king of a realm, region%}, or rgyal phran, {%petty%}
{%ruler%}); so, °rāja iva mantrigaṇaparivṛtaḥ Divy 126.4;
148.15; 182.9; Av i.108.7; sarvakoṭṭarājānāṃ cātur-
dvīpakānāṃ ca sattvānāṃ Dbh 81.17; mānitāś ca bhavi-
ṣyāmo 'navadyāś ca sarvakoṭṭarājabhiḥ (so read with
several mss. for Lefm. °koṭa°), {%and we shall be honored%}
{%and not contemned by all k°%} (surely foreign princes) LV
137.3; viṃśati ca sahasra paryantakāḥ koṭṭarājās tathā…
LV 94.16 (vs), here they approach Śuddhodana sub-
missively, possibly they may be vassals of his, but it
seems more likely that they are foreign princes; but in
other cases they seem clearly to be part of the king's
own retinue or at least direct dependents, apparently
officers; so in LV 118.10 (Śuddhodana gives orders to
the people of his city) saṃnipātyantāṃ sarvakoṭṭarājānaḥ,
ekībhavantu śreṣṭhi-gṛhapaty-amātya-dauvārika-pāriṣa-
dyāḥ; Mv i.231.15 rājā aśītihi koṭṭarājasahasrehi sār-
dhaṃ anyāye ca janatāye; 234.16 rājñā ca arcimena
aśītihi ca koṭṭarājāna-sahasrehi (one cpd. word!); Divy
61.16 Śaṅkho 'pi rājā aśītikoṭṭarājasahasraparivāro; KP
84.8 (kumāraṃ) sarvaśreṣṭhinaigamajānapatayaḥ (read
°padāḥ) koṭṭarājānaś ca namasyanti; Sukh 68.1 (amātyān
stryāgārāñ śreṣṭhino) gṛhapatīn koṭṭarājāṃś ca paryeṣayed.
It is, however, perhaps possible to take the word in all
these latter cases as meaning {%vassal prince%}. The context
gives no clue to the mg. in SP 433.4; Suv 153.9.
