{@grahika@}¦, adj.,? Mvy 2449, in a list of evil qualities;
pw 7.339 guesses ‘etwa bissig’; Tib. dus ({%time%}) po che
({%great%}), which I cannot interpret (is it connected with
sdud pa, which might render grah, {%collect, bring together%},
perhaps in a corrupt form ?); one Chin. rendering {%vain,%}
{%futile, time-wasting%} (does Tib. mean {%[consuming] much%}
{%time?%}), {%useless%}. Etymologically one might guess {%grasping,%}
{%avaricious%}, or the like.
