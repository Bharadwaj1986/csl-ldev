{@tāpa-@}¦ = tapas, {%ascetic practice%} (a mg. unrecorded for
tāpa or its MIndic equivalents); in Mvy 1608, chapter-
title, tāpa-saṃvāra-paryāyāḥ, {%words for ascetic practices%}
{%and restraints%}; {@saṃvāra@} is also unparallelled in the sense
of {@saṃvara@}; Tib. dkaḥ thub, which regularly = tapas,
and sdom pa, which regularly = saṃvara. Perhaps read
tapaḥ-saṃvara-; but Mironov (p. vi) cites both words
as in Kyoto ed.
