{@chambati@}¦ (= Pali chambhati, perhaps to be read
here; derivs. of this root are spelled with b, not bh, in this
text; see also {@sa-cchambita@}; cf. the next entries, and
{@(ac)chambhin, (ac)chambhita(tva))@}, {%is frightened%}: bi-
bhety api chambaty apy uttrasaty api, Dhvajāgrasūtra,
Waldschmidt, Kl. Skt. Texte 4, p. 49, line 23. The MIndic
chambhati is clearly based on Skt. skambh-; BHS (rarely)
uses the equivalent stambh- in the same sense, see {@a-@}
{@stambhin@}.
