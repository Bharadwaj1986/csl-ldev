{@sparśa-vihāra-tā@}¦ (once by error °vihāri-tā; etym.,
see below), {%state of comfort, agreeable condition%}: SP 248.6;
Bhīk 26a.3; in comp. with preceding sukha-, Kv 18.8
(here text erroneously °vihāri-tā); 89.13; oftener with
sukhaṃ as separate and parallel near-synonym, Mv
i.256.10; 323.20 (here sukha-tā); 324.5; Divy 156.14; Av
i.326.1; ii.93.16. See {@asparśavihāra@}; and {@phāsu, phāsa,@}
{@(a)phāṣa(ka)@}. The Pali equivalent is (a)phāsu(ka), often
with vihāra; and AMg. has phāsuya (-vihāra). Pischel 208
derives from *sparśuka; Skt. sparśavant, BHS {@sparśana-@}
{@vant@}, {%pleasant to touch%}, suggest how the development of
mg. might conceivably have taken place, but Pischel's
form is unrecorded. In BHS sparśa- is the regular form in
this cpd., but others occur, see above. It may be only a
hyper-Sktism. The -u of the stem seems to be universally
found in Pali and Pkt., and occurs in BHS, but never
followed by -ka, a fact which is not helpful to Pischel's
etymology. The Jain Skt. form is prāsuka, interpreted
as {%free from living creatures%} (pra-asu; of a dwelling, vihāra,
suitable for Jain monks); this looks like a fanciful hyper-
Sktism. Various other etymologies have been suggested,
see the Pali Dictt.; none are convincing. Note the use of
phāsuṃ, phāṣaṃ as adverbs with viharati.The forms
phāsa, phāṣa are recorded only in BHS.
