{@? voṇṭa@}¦, m. (noted Skt. Lex., and Hem. Pkt. Gr.
i.139, as = Skt. vṛnta, but no mg. of that word seems
to fit here; rather prob. related to {@vṛndi@}, q.v.), prob.
{%insect-shell%}: Mvy 5995, among śaṅkhādi-nāmāni; after
kapardikā, before abhraka, khaṭikā; Tib. srin Ikog, or
sriṅ khog, neither of which is comprehensible to me; prob.
read srin ({%insect%}) khog ({%body%}, or {%trunk%}; -can, applied to a
tortoise); Chin. {%shell of an insect%} (such as a cricket); the
Mongolian Mvy takes Tib. to mean {%body, trunk, of insects%}
(or more generally, including amphibious animals and
fish).
