{@? āmbhirya@}¦, (m. or nt.) °rye LV 156.21 (prose), one
of the arts (kalā); from the context (after bārhaspatye and
before āsurye) perhaps a philosophic system; v.l. ambhīrye
(also ācīrye, asvīrye, but Tib. chuḥi lugs, {%way%}, or {%system,%}
{%of water%} indicates that the orig. began ambh- or āmbh-,
tho it does not give much further help).
