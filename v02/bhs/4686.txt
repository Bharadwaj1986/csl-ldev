{@-kāṭaka@}¦, nt., in pātra-kāṭakam Mvy 8952, {%ring%} or
which the almsbowl is fastened, = Tib. lhuṅ gzed (bzed
gzhag paḥi gdu bu, {%ring for putting almsbowl%}. BR cite the
passage with kaṭaka (as in Skt. and Pali), but Mironov also
kā°; no v.l. in either ed. (but Index to Kyoto ed. cites
both forms). However a form found with the same mg.
in Divy and Av is {@-karaka@} or {@-kara@}, qq.v. On the other
hand, Divy likewise has a form {@kaṇṭaka@}, q.v., clearly
meaning the same thing, which raises doubts as to the
etym. Cf. {@kaṭaka@}.
