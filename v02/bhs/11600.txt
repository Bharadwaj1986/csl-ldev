({@1@}) in the sense of Skt. Marut, a class of Vedic gods: indro
…maruhi parivṛto Mv iii.267.16 (vs); in this sense rare;
({@2@}) very commonly, {%god%}, = deva, sura; oftenest in vss,
but also in prose, e.g. nara-maru-kanyā- LV 82.15; often,
as here, bracketed with nara or a synonym: SP 12.13;
30.9; 208.9; LV 12.13; 80.19 (read ca marusahasrair);
129.19; 370.14; Mv i.71.21; 72.11, 15, etc.; 90.18; 100.9;

Mv i.259.11; ii.180.8; 410.7; iii.443.13; ({@4@}) n. of a future
Buddha: Mv ii.355.10, but this is prob. a misprint for
{@Meru@}, in the same passage iii.279.15.
