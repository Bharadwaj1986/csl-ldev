{@? samīhati@}¦ (in Pali may, it seems, mean {%moves%},
intrans.: ākāsamhi °ti Vv.5.1, comm. 35.15 ff…carati
gacchati), ppp. (vāyu-)samīhita, {%stirred (by the wind)%},
based on act. (caus.?) mg. (°hayati?): °tā kisalayās LV
326.4 (vs). The mg. is certain, the reading less so; some
mss. °samīritā; but the occurrence of māra-samīritāḥ in
the prec. line suggests that this v.l. may have been only
a lect. fac.; most and the best mss. are reported with
°samīhitā.
