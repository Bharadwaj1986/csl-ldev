{@mrakṣa@}¦, m. (= Pali makkha, which never means
{%hypocrisy%}, as usually rendered; CPD under (a-)makkha
more correctly {%disparaging%}, sc. good qualities of others;
= paraguṇa-makkhana-lakkhaṇo, tesaṃ vināsana-raso,
tadavacchādanapaccupaṭṭhāno (see {@pratyupasthāna@})
MN comm. i.106.26 f., on MN i.15.35; similarly tho less
fully comm. on Dhp. 150 and 407; AN comm. ii.162.28,
on AN i.95.15; in Pugg. 18.25, 22.29 f. read niṭṭhuriya
for niddhunīya; AN and MN comms. l.c. define the
associated paḷāsa, our {@pradāsa@}, q.v., by yugaggāha,
{%grasping after preëminence for oneself over others%}), despite
usual rendering {%hypocrisy%} or the like, never has that mg.;
primarily, {%concealment of the good qualities of others, jealous%}
{%disparagement, nasty disposition, ill-will%}, finally (like
{@mrakṣya@}, q.v.) virtually = krodha, {%anger%}: this last
development seems clearly complete in Karmav 37.19
text krodhaḥ, upanāhaḥ, mrakṣaḥ, pradāśaḥ, but for the
last read with ms. paridāghaḥ, cf. Śikṣ 198.8 below; yet
Mvy 1963 and Dharmas 69 mrakṣaḥ after krodha, upanāha,
and before pradāsa (°śa); prob. same mg. in LV 262.17
(vs) krodha-mrakṣau; usually in rather misc. lists of vices;
between māna and mada (after which comes krodha)
LV 52.13; 411.16; after māna and mada Mv ii.229.20;
between mātsarya and māna SP 481.4; after māna and
mada, (before paridāha) Śikṣ 198.8, (before krodha) KP
7.3; after māna Mv i.166.20; Ud xvi.23 (= Pali Dhp. 150
māno makkho); after śāṭhya, vakratā, kauṭilya, māna
SP 107.1; krodherṣyā-śāṭhya-mrakṣādayaś Bbh 20.15;
krodha upanāhaḥ śāṭhyam īrṣyā pradāso (ed. °dāno)
mrakṣo mātsaryaṃ…Dharmas 30. Tib., in all passages
known to me (Mvy, LV, KP), renders ḥchab pa, {%conceal-%}
{%ment%}, which is somewhat etymological (mrakṣ, {%smear,%}
{%anoint%}), but not erroneous, only incomplete; it means
primarily {%concealment of the good qualities of others%}, not
(as nearly all have assumed) of one's own faults.
