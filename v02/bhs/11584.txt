{@manyanā, °na@}¦ chiefly m.c. (= Pali maññanā; cf.
next; to manyate plus -anā), (1) {%conceit%} in the sense of
{%vain, illusory imagining%}, Tib. ṅor sems, in Suzuki's Index
[Page419-b+ 71]
to Laṅk; (2) {%conceit%} in the sense of {%pride%}, Tib. rlom(s)
sems, so rendered in Mvy, Śikṣ, and KP below. The two
mgs. cannot always be distinguished with certainty but
({@1@}) is doubtless regularly meant when the word is asso-
ciated with {@iñjana, °nā@}, or {@iñjita@}, qq.v. for passages
like Gv 128.6; 253.14; Dbh 64.13; so in LV 259.9 (vs)
where read na ceñjanaṃ nāpi manyana-(m.c. for °nā)-
pracāraṃ (Lefm. manyena, metr. impossible), and prob.
in KP 136.8 (vs) iñjanā-manyana-, tho Tib. here rlom

dharmā manyanāyāḥ samutthitāḥ, sāpy atra manyanā
śūnyā yayā śūnyeti manyate; ({@2@}) {%pride%}: in LV 332.14
(vs) read with best mss. (and Tib., rlom sems) sarva-
manyanā-(Lefm. manyunā)-prahīnāḥ; in LV 371.13 (vs)
read, with vv.ll. and Foucaux, iha me hatā navavidhā

{%here I have destroyed the nine-fold varieties of conceit, which%}
{%have pride as their home%} (or {%body%}, pura) {%and%} (now are left
in me) {%without any resting-place%}; in LV 374.5 (vs) read
manyanāś with v.l. for mamiyitā; Mvy 7082 = Tib.
rlom(s) sems; Śikṣ 251.8 (Tib. cited as rlom sems); śīla-
