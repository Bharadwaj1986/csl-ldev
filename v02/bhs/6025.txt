{@caccara@}¦ (m. or nt.; = Pali id., Skt. catvara), {%square,%}
{%four-crossroads%}: so it seems that the mss. must read, or
intend, at SP 88.1 (vs), where KN sthitu catvarasmin
(kept by WT without note), but with note over the final
letter: ‘O. care the others caresmin’. This very imperfect
annotation seems to mean that the Nep. mss. have cac-
caresmin (*cacaresmin or *caresmin would be unparallelled,
morphologically and semantically incomprehensible, and
metrically impossible); caccare, seemingly the reading of
‘O’ = Kashgar rec., would be metrically defective, lacking
the necessary last syllable.
