{@gahanatā@}¦ (app. = Pali gahaṇa, below; cf. prec.),
designates some sort of heresy: Śikṣ 172.3 (prose) idam
agraṃ mithyādṛṣṭīnāṃ, yad uta gahanatā-dṛṣṭiḥ. Ed. note
refers to Dhp. comm. iii.494.1 (on Dhp. 318 micchādiṭṭhi-
samādānā) gahaṇa-saṃkhātāya micchādiṭṭhiyā samādin-
nattā, {%from being taken by the heresy called gahaṇa%}; the
domal ṇ suggests connexion with Skt. and BHS {@grahaṇa@},
which Bendall says is also shown by the Tib. rendering,
which he quotes as gziṅs pa (connecting it with ḥdzin pa).
The Dhp. context suggests that it consists in taking what
is sinful for no sin, and vice versa; perh. then lit. {%holding%}
(perverse views on morals)? Unfortunately I find no other
evidence for the heresy referred to, in either Pali or BHS.
Bendall and Rouse: {%the chiefest of all false doctrine, that is,%}
{%the heresy of clinging to the world%} (would this be called a
{%false doctrine%}, dṛṣṭi?).
