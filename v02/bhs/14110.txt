{@vimokṣa@}¦, m. (Skt. id., Pali vimokkha), {%release,%}
{%salvation%}. As in Pali, there are three, or eight, vi°; the
three are in Pali suññato, animitto, appaṇihito vi°, ex-
plained Vism. 658, and in Dharmas 73 śūnyato 'nimitto
'praṇihitaś ca; in Mvy 1541--4, three vi°-mukhāni, {%approach-%}
{%es, entrances to…%}, listed as śūnyatā-, animittaṃ (sc.
°mukham), apraṇihitaṃ; references to the three (or three-
fold) vi° (often foll. by -mukha, or corruptly -sukha), LV
9.6; 181.20; 205.3; 359.22; 374.10; Gv 472.9; in Laṅk
163.4 vimokṣa-traya seems, however, to mean the opposite
of the three {@saṃgati@} (q.v. 2), which seems to mean the
three {@saṃdhi@} (q.v. 6); the eight vi° explained at length
Mvy 1510--1518 (corresp. to Pali vimokkha); more briefly,
and with accidental omission of the third, Dharmas 59;
references to 8 vi°, SP 150.2; 180.1 (prose, read aṣṭavi-
mokṣā(ḥ) with mss., Bhvr., {%possessing the 8 vimokṣa%},
exactly like ṣaḍabhijñā(ḥ) just before; note in ed. and
em. wrong); 202.11; Av ii.69.2; {@Bodhisattva-vimokṣa@}
means a Mahāyāna method of salvation; various fanciful
names are given to such mystical (and not specifically
described) methods; e.g. in Gv 261.4 a ‘night-goddess’
claims to have learned the Bodhisattva-vi° called samanta-
bhadraprītivipulavimalavegadhvaja. See also {@vimukti@}.
