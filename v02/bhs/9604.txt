{@puni@}¦, in LV 151.8 (vs) seemingly m.c. for *pune,
certainly represents punar, {%but%}; both edd. read so, no v.l.
No *pune seems to be recorded, even in a MIndic equiva-
lent (as *puṇe, *uṇe). Possibly it may be assumed as loc.
to the ‘stem’ puna- (Pkt. puṇa-, uṇa-) recorded by Pischel
(see under {@punā@}). Less likely, in my opinion, *pune as
‘Māgadhism’ for MIndic puno.
