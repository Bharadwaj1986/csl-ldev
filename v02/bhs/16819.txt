{@? siṃhāsapīṭha@}¦ (°supīṭha ?), adj., only in first half
of an anuṣṭubh vs, °pīṭho (or °pīṭhā) balavān: Mv ii.431.17
(here printed as prose, wrongly); 458.10; iii.7.2, 13; 13.9;
so mss., with practically no variants except °sa° or °su°,
°ṭhā or °ṭho; Senart has various emendations and suggested
interpretations, doubting at last (iii n. 466) his suggestion
of ii n. 568, -sapīṭha = sadṛśa, {%(lion-)like%}; except that the
mg. must be in effect {%strong%}, or the like, I cannot interpret
the word. It may be cpd. with the foll. balavān, and is
doubtless corrupt. (Divide siṃhāsa-[= siṃhāsana-]-pīṭho?)
