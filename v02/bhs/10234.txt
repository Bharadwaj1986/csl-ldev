{@pratyanubhavati@}¦ (= Pali paccanubhoti), ({@1@}) gen-
erally, {%experiences, undergoes%}, often indistinguishable from
(Skt.) anubhavati: °vati Mvy 7280 = Tib. so sor myoṅ
bar ḥgyur, {%experiences severally%} (cf. 7281 vedayati = Tib.
myoṅ bar ḥgyur), but it is doubtful whether prati should
ever be rendered {%severally%} in this cpd.; a possible case is
sukhaṃ duḥkhaṃ °vati Karmav 56.21 and 57.3, where
for 56.21 Lévi says {%éprouve respectivement%}, but in the
close parallel 57.2 anubhūtam is used, without prati; on
the other hand, in many cases the word refers definitely
to what is experienced as a result af past deeds, so that
one is inclined to render prati {%in return, as recompense%};
so in Karmav above, and in: (paśyantu…aniṣṭaṃ)
phalavipākaṃ pratyanubhūyamānam (in hells) Bbh
151.19; karmāṇāṃ (karma-) vipākaṃ °vanti Mv i.16.13;
18.6; (Pūrṇena) karmāṇi kṛtāny upacitāni ko 'nyaḥ
°viṣyati, {%who else will experience%} ({%in return%}, sc. the
effects of) {%deeds done and accumulated by…%}, a familiar
cliché, Divy 54.4; 131.9; 141.9; 191.14; Av i.74.4; 80.10,
etc.; puṇyaphalaṃ °bhavataḥ (gen. sg. pres. pple) Divy
213.26, and °bhavanti 222.3; sukhaṃ °vāmi Divy 10.14;
11.30; sukhāni °bhaveyuḥ Suv 113.8; 127.16; duḥkhaṃ
°vāmi Av i.339.3; vividhā duḥkhāni °bhavanto (pres.
pple.) Mv i.27.3; duḥkhāni °viṣyanti SP 78.1, and °vanti
2; kam arthaṃ °viṣyati, or °vati, {%what advantage will%}
(does) {%he experience (in recompense)?%} Av ii.140.10, 11;
141.10, 11; 142.8, 9; there is, however, no clear evidence
of the notion of {%recompense%} in duḥkhāni °vanti SP 77.14;
saṃsāraduḥkhaṃ °bhavataḥ…sattvān dṛṣṭvā Gv 319.10;
and in some cases such a notion seems improbable or even
impossible, as in: (Māyā) na codaragatāni °vati LV 71.7;
mahatīṃ ratiṃ °viṣyatha SP 80.2, {%you will enjoy your-%}
{%selves very much%}; ratikrīḍāṃ °vati Divy 531.7, {%enjoys love-%}
{%sport%}; praśāsana-ratiḥ (so both edd.; prose, no v.l.; but
an acc. is certainly meant, as Foucaux's transl. correctly
renders; read °ratīḥ or °ratiṃ?) °vati LV 16.5, (a cakra-
vartin) {%enjoys the pleasures of rulership%}; (nagaraparva)
°vitum Av i.122.3, {%to take part in (experience, enjoy) the%}
{%city-holiday%}; divyamānuṣīṃ śriyaṃ °viṣyati Divy 262.20;
263.7, 20--21 (predicted of an unborn child); idaṃ…
duḥkhaṃ na kadācit °vanti…yādṛśaṃ vayaṃ °vāmaḥ
Kv 25.13-14; also 27.8, 21, 22; ({@2@}) with object {%magic%}
{%power%} (ṛddhi, etc.), uncertain whether mg. is {%experiences,%}
{%enjoys%}, as prec., or {%gets, acquires%} (so anubhavati in Pali,
CPD): anekavidhām ṛddhiṃ (Dbh ṛddhividhiṃ) °vati
Mv iii.409.2; Dbh 34.24; anekavidham ṛddhiviṣayaṃ °vati
Mvy 215, where Tib. myoṅ bar byed pa, {%makes experienced%};
but in mentioning one of the specific powers of ṛddhi,
in the sequel to the same passage, Dbh 34.26 and Mvy
218 āvirbhāvaṃ (Mvy āvirbhavati) tirobhāvam api °vati,
substantially {%he is able to appear and disappear%} by magic,
Tib. on Mvy simply ḥgyur, prec. by ‘terminative’ (in -r),
{%attains to%} (the power of)…; perhaps so in Dbh 82.19
(sa tān sarvān samādhīn samāpadyate ca…samādhi-
kauśalyānugataś ca yāvat samādhikāryaṃ tat sarvaṃ)
°bhavati, {%…until he attains%} (? {%experiences?%} or perhaps
{%reaches%} in the sense of {%is adequate to%}, see 3 below ?) {%that%}
{%whole matter of the samādhis%}; ({@3@}) {%suffices for, is sufficient%}
{%to produce%} (= {@anubhavati@}, q.v., and in passage parallel
[Page375-a+ 71]
to those there cited): (sūryācandramasāv…ābhayābhāṃ
na) pratyanubhavatas Divy 205.25; possibly also in Dbh
82.19, under 2 above.
