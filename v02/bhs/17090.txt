{@sumbhaka@}¦ (once a ms. śu°), nt., a {%bowl%} of the sort
used as {%almsbowl%} by Buddhist monks: the mg. is made
clear by Mv iii.459.22 (vs) evaṃ te anvayiṣyāmi ādāya
sumbhakaṃ tathā (so one ms., v.l. ādāya ca su°, Senart
em. ādāya tava su°), = Pali Jāt. v.259.23…pattam
ādāya pacchato (pattam, {%bowl%}, = sumbhakam); other-
wise found only as modifier of pātraṃ, in the cliché which
tells how after ordination by the {@ehibhikṣukā@} formula,
the signs of worldly life were magically replaced in the
initiate(s) by monkish insignia: (…gṛhikalpaṃ sarvaṃ
samantarahitaṃ, tricīvarā ca prādurbhūtā) sumbhakaṃ
(mss., Senart here em. wrongly) ca pātraṃ prakṛtisvabhā-
vasaṃsthitā ca keśā, etc., Mv ii.234.5; substantially same
formula (sometimes pl., °kā or °kāni ca pātrā or pātrāṇi),
[Page602-a+ 70]
iii.65.5; 92.9; 180.15; 181.6; 329.12; 379.15 (one ms. śu°);
413.13; 423.9; 430.17. The word has not been found
elsewhere; but cf. {@sumbhalikā@}.
