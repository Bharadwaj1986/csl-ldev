{@śaṅkhasvara-samācāra@}¦, adj. m. (Pali saṅkassara,
usually cpd. with samācāra, or sometimes ācāra; sometimes
the Pali cpd. begins with asuci-; Pali comms., e.g. Pugg.
comm. 207.5 ff., Dhp. comm. iii.485.1 ff., have various
labored and implausible interpretations assuming connexion
with saṅkā = Skt. śaṅkā, root śaṅk), {%of vile conduct%};
etym. and precise mg. unknown; follows kaṣambaka-jāta
(see {@kaś°@}) in Mvy, MSV, and occurs in the same cliché
in Pali, referring to wicked monks: Mvy 9140; MSV i.50.7;
Śikṣ 64.5. Tib. on Mvy cited as lug pon (?) ltar ({%like%})
spyad pa ({%conduct%}); Mvy 9141 and 9142 (not in Mironov)
are given as synonyms or variants, {@khānta-samācāra@}
and {@saṃkasu@} (note k, not kh) {@samācāra@}; Tib. this time
(on 9141) luṅ rul-ba ({%rotten%}, see s.v. kaśambaka-) lta-bur
gyur-pa; Jap. rendering of 9142 contains the word {%rotten%}.
Both Mvy 9141 and 9142 seem evident corruptions, and
śaṅkha-svara- looks like an unhistoric (hyper-Skt.) form.
The Tib. renderings are prob. also corrupt; at least the
Tib. Dictt. give no clue to what they might mean. Perhaps
luṅ (on Mvy 9141), and maybe even lug (on Mvy 9140),
may be corrupt for duṅ = Skt. śaṅkha, {%shell%}.
