{@vṛṣabhi-tā@}¦ (to next, plus -tā; cf. {@ātma-vṛṣ°@}), =
prec.; mss., esp. Kashgar rec. of SP, sometimes present
a nt. vṛṣabhita, which is however never well supported
[Page507-b+ 71]
and surely only a corruption; Bendall even emends Śiks
ms. °tā to °ta, referring to Mv ii.277.8, but this is a Bhvr.
adj., so that stem in -ta is normal (Māra speaks and refers
to himself as mahā-vṛṣabhitaṃ, acc. sg., {%having great%}
{%majesty%}, parallel with mahāpratāpaṃ, mahāvikramaṃ);
otherwise all unambiguous passages show always °tā, at
least in some mss.; usually a quality of a Buddha: siṃha-
vṛṣabhitābhigarjitanirghoṣasvara LV 435.15 (of Buddha);
(saṃprakāśayati) tathāgata-°tāṃ (so v.l., text °taṃ) SP
308.5; tathāgatena tathāgata-°bhitā tathāgataparākramaḥ
kṛtaḥ 311.5; sarvabuddha-°bhitā 391.3; (buddha-) °bhitā-
sukhena Śikṣ 214.1 (ms.), {%by the bliss of the majesty of a%}
{%Buddha%}; buddha-°tām AsP 432.10; very common in Gv,
e.g. (tathāgatadharmacakrapravartana-)-vikurvita-°bhi-
tām 6.2 (cf. Dbh 73.16 under prec.); acintyaṃ tathāgata-
buddha-°bhitādhiṣṭhānam 7.22; buddhavyūhān buddha-
°bhitāṃ (so read with 2d ed. for 1st ed. °tān) 17.24; na
sā °bhitā 19.7; acintyāṃ buddha-°bhitāṃ 21.1, etc.
