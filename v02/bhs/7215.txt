{@dadhi-pradyotika@}¦, adv. °kaṃ (vā dīpyamānasya),
Śikṣ 182.3, in a list of tortures, after {@taila-pradyotikaṃ@},
[Page262-a+ 71]
q.v., and {@sarpiḥ-pra°@}; Bendall and Rouse render this
{%(burnt with blazing…) ghee%}, on what ground I do not
know; dadhi seems always to mean {%sour milk%} or {%curds%} in
Skt., Pali, and (dahi) Pkt. literature. Some inflammable
material must be meant; acc. to Skt. Lexicons, dadhi also
may mean {%turpentine%} or {%resin%} (BR), here perhaps the
latter.
