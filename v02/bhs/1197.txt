{@anyatara@}¦, adj., like Pali aññatara (and cf. {@katara@},
q.v.) is very commonly used without its Skt. limitation
to {%one of two%}; rather, as equivalent of Skt. anyatama
(which is also used in BHS in the same way, notably in
Divy and Av), and chiefly ({@1@}) in the mg. {%a certain%}; (an
unspecified) {%one (of many)%}: Mv i.36.10 (here could be
interpreted in mg. 2); 343.4; ii.31.19; 65.1; 96.15; 145.4;
171.9; 461.14; iii.15.7; 53.13; Divy 102.8; 226.19; 227.26;

39.16; Śikṣ 39.1 (wrongly rendered {%another%} by Bendall
and Rouse); Gv 84.17; Karmav 32.12; 35.16; Laṅk
176.8; ({@2@}) much more rarely, {%another, any other%} (of an
unlimited number); so possibly (but not probably) Mv

{%less%} (not to speak of) {%in regard to any other external matter%};
