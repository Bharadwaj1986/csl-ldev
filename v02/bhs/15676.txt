{@satpuruṣa@}¦ (cf. Skt. id., Pali sappurisa), lit. {%worthy%}
or {%true man%}: Mvy 7358; sixteen s° listed SP 3.10, the chief
being Bhadrapāla, who is the only one named in RP 2.3,
where 16 are also referred to. They are evidently a lay
category, and are mentioned immediately after a list of
Bodhisattvas. According to Professor Paul Mus (oral com-
munication, May, 1949), they are a kind of lay equivalent
of the Bodhisattvas, who live the life of gṛhapatis; Prof.
Mus finds a typical illustration of them in the figure of
{@Vimalakīrti@} (q.v.), so well known in Chinese Buddhism.
In BHS, V. is not listed so far as I know except once in
a list of 16 Bodhisattvas. The term satpuruṣa may include
monks: Mv i.37.4 (see s.v. {@labhā, labhyaṃ@}).
