{@lakṣa@}¦ (Skt.), {%mark%}: anena ca lakṣa-nikṣepeṇa SP
316.10 (prose), {%and by this depositing of the sort just described%},
lit. {%by this mark-deposit%}, or, perhaps better, {%by this de-%}
{%positing on the%} (designated) {%mark%} (target, lakṣa). Acc. to
Senart, lakṣa is read for {@lakṣaṇa@} (4) by mss. at Mv i.207.16,
where he keeps it, tho in the repetition ii.12.6 he keeps
lakṣaṇa with mss. there; in i.62.12 he em. lakṣa for lak-
ṣaṇa, alleging metrical grounds, but the resulting meter
is not correct; read rather maha-(m.c. for mahā-)-puru-
ṣalakṣaṇavarāṇāṃ; and in i.207.16 we must also read,
with ii.12.6, dvātriṃśallakṣaṇadharo (or °śa-lakṣaṇa-
dharo?). There is no evidence that the Buddhist 32 lak-
ṣaṇa were ever called lakṣa, despite Skt. lakṣa for lakṣaṇa,
