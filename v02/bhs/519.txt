{@adhvānīya@}¦ (better adhvaniya; Pali addhaniya), {%fit%}
{%for a journey%}: some such form seems clearly intended by
mss. at Mv iii.93.19; they read (nātyātiśītaṃ nātyātiuṣṇaṃ)
ṛtusukhaṃ adhvānīyaṃ (v.l. adhyā°) taṃ bhagavantaṃ
(read bhavantaṃ, or bhadanta, m.c.; object of paśyantu,
next line, or voc.). They are clearly corrupt, but Senart's
emendations are proved wrong by the Pali parallel Therag.
529; divide ṛtu (ṛtuṃ? ṛtū?) sukhaṃ, {%the season is pleasant%}
{%and fit for travel%}.
