<L>2079<pc>072,1<k1>अवदर्पित<k2>अवदर्पित
{@? avadarpita@}¦, in LV 275.8 sv-avadarpita-vimala-
buddhir; textually uncertain; mss. vary greatly on ava°;
many omit vimala; Tib. śin tu (= su) dkar baḥi ({%white%},
often = avadāta) blo (= buddhi) daṅ ldan pa ({%having%}),
apparently omitting vimala, and suggesting that it is
based on avadāta, {%white%}, i.e., {%bright%}, instead of avadarpita,
which is nowhere recorded and seems senseless, as do the
alternative readings of the other BHS mss.
