{@upakleśa@}¦, m. (also semi-MIndic {@°kileśa@}; cf. {@upakli-@}
{@śyate@}; = Pali upakkilesa, of which 5, 10, or 18 are enumer-
ated; evidently there was no definitively fixed list), {%(minor,%}
{%secondary) impurity, stain, depravity%}; in most texts no
very clear distinction is made between them and the
{@kleśa@} in principle, but AbhidhK. La V-P. v.88 ff. (see esp.
89 of Transl. note 2) insists on the fundamental distinction,
and comm. cites a list of 21 upa°; they ‘proceed from’
kleśa, 91; a list of 24 in Dharmas 69, whereas in 67 the
6 kleśa have been listed; 4 upak° listed Bbh 10.7 (caturbhir
upakleśair…upakliṣṭo bhavati) and 22 ff. (no relation
to Dharmas list); Mvy 2138, following saṃyojana, ban-
dhana, anuśaya, paryutthāna, and followed by paryava-
sthāna (so read); cf. Bbh 202.20 saṃyojana-bandhanānu-
śayopakleśa-paryavasthānānām; Śikṣ 222.10 (defining
upāyāsa) (ye cānya evamādaya) upakleśās ta upāyāsāḥ;
cf. KP 93.3 sopadravaḥ sopakleśa(ḥ) sopāyāso; KP 99.2,
see s.v. {@upakliśyate@}; Mv i.228.11, 15 vigatopakileśena;
SP 318.2 (sattvānām alpakuśalamūlānāṃ) bahūpakleśā-
nām; Laṅk 358.11 (vs) upakleśair manādibhiḥ (see s.v.
{@mana@}, app. m.c. for māna, which however is standardly
one of the kleśa); 369.4 °śair na lipyate. The word seems
likely to have been originally a noun cpd., upa plus
{@kleśa@}, the rare verb upakliśyate may be a back-formation
from it; yet the ppp. upakkiliṭṭha occurs in canonical Pali.
