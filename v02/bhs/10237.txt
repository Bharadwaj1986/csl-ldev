{@pratyanuyukta@}¦, adj. or subst. m. (cf. next), in Mvy
7664, opp. of anuyukta 7665, Tib. respectively phyir
(= {%back, in return%}) brgal, and brgal ba; this may be
derived from rgal ba, {%cross(ed) over%} (e.g. a river); so Chin.
interprets, and also praty-anu° {%crossed back%}; but jä.
also allows brgal to be connected with rgol ba, {%contend%}
{%with, attack%}, and states that phyir rgol ba refers to {%defense%}
{%against attacks%}; derivatives of these two are used of {%plaintiff%}
and {%defendant%} in lawsuits, and of {%disputants%} in academic
arguments. In this latter sense Jap. interprets pratya-
nuyuktaḥ Mvy 7664, and this seems likely to be right;
anuyukta then prob. {%examined, questioned%} (ppp. of Pali
anuyuñjati, b in CPD), and praty-anu° {%counter-questioned,%}
{%cross-examined%}.
