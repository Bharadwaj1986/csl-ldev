{@samodita@}¦, adj.-ppp., prob. {%originated, arisen, come%}
{%into being%}, cf. {@samudaya@} and {@samo°@}; only in vss of Mmk,
where it could be m.c., § 3.71, for samudita (which seems
to occur in Pali in this mg., tho rarely); but Pali has
samodita in prose, once at least in the mg. {%assembled,%}
{%united%} (Vv. comm. 320.28), which samudita has in Skt.;
this mg. would be possible in some of the Mmk passages
(many of which are obscure and likely to be corrupt;
they are here reproduced as printed): karma eṣa sadā
vindyād vidhimuktā samoditā Mmk 180.4; tithayaś ca
°tā 194.3; ulkāṃ liṅgair ebhiḥ °tām 200.18; yasmin deśe
°tā 211.3; yatra sthite °tā 212.14; nānānāma-°tāḥ 214.21;
