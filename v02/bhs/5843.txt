{@--gocarika@}¦, adj., ({@1@}) {%providing sustenance%} (see s.v.
{@gocara@}, 3) {%for…%} (monks): (tatraiko) baṇig bhikṣugoca-
rikaḥ Divy 307.21; ({@2@}) (= Pali gocariya, see below), ? an
epithet of wool, some of which is to be used in making
coverlets for monks, Prāt 496.10, 12; they are to be made
of two parts ‘pure black’ (śuddha-kāḍānāṃ) wool, one
part white (avadātānāṃ), and the fourth part gocarikā-
nāṃ (gen. pl.), which acc. to Finot is rendered in Chin.
by (wool) {%of inferior quality%}. In the close Pali parallel
Vin. iii.226.25 ff. (ignored in PTSD; Childers records it
from Minayeff's Prātimokṣa S.) the corresponding epithet,
gocariya, is said by the comm. 684.21 to mean {%tawny%}
(kapilavaṇṇānaṃ); this is adopted by Childers; also
transl. SBE 13.25 ‘of the colour of oxen (reddish brown)’,
or (below) ‘tawny’; it seems like a dubious guess.
