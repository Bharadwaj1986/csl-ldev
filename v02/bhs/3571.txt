{@? uddhya@}¦ (m. ? so Skt. Lex., once in literature, BR),
perhaps {%river, stream%} (suspected by BR of being only n.
pr. of a river); in LV 274.12 (prose) (mahatā) puṣpāḍhyena
(pravarṣatā), should mean {%with a great stream of flowers%}
{%raining down%}. Both edd. puṣpāḍhyena, which can only
be understood if a noun for {%stream%} or {%rain%} is supplied;
nearly all mss. puṣpodyena; udya is recorded as v.l. in
a Hindu Lex. for uddhya, see BR; perhaps read puṣpod-
dhyena, or even puṣpodyena with mss. ? Tib. me tog maṅ
poḥi char chen po ni ḥbebs, {%a great rain of many flowers%}
{%rained down%}.
