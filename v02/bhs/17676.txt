{@hārāhāra@}¦, in °ra-kuśalāḥ Sukh 59.9, said of people
born in Sukhāvatī, in long list of descriptive epithets;
foll. by nayānaya-kuśalāḥ sthāna-(corruption of sthānā-
sthāna-? Müller's Transl., note)-kuśalāḥ; Müller, {%clever in%}
{%taking and refusing%}; the foll. nayānaya- suggests Artha-
śāstra (cf. Jāt. vi.581.22 hāra-hārinī, ep. of an army, senā,
of uncertain mg., comm. haritabba-haraṇa-samatthā, not
very plausibly), but {%war-raids%} (of all kinds ? § 23.12) would
not be appropriate to Sukhāvatī; prob. all these terms
have rather an intellectual application (cf. {@sthāna@}); but
the precise mg. escapes me.
