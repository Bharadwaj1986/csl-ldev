{@dharmarājikā@}¦, once {@dhārm°@} (from {@dharmarājan@} 1),

lit. (edifice) {%which belongs to%} (serves for relics of) {%the king%}
{%of the doctrine%} (= Buddha); {%a stūpa%}. So correctly BR;
Burnouf Intr. 370 n. 1 and 631 is uncertain; Divy Index
wrongly {%royal edict on the law%}. The mg. seems clear from
(caturaśīti-) dharmarājikā-sahasraṃ pratiṣṭhāpayeyam
Divy 381.14, °sraṃ pratiṣṭhāpitam 18, 23, while in the
same passage, describing the same performance, in verse,
we read: cakre stūpānāṃ…sāśīti…sahasram 21. To
my mind this settles the matter. Other occurrences, always
with forms of pratiṣṭhāpayati, {%establishes, founds%}: Divy
379.22; 381.5; 402.19; 405.15, 16; 419.15; 429.13; 433.27;
434.1; also dhārmarājikā 368.28.
