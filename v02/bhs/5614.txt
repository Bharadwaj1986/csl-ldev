{@gata@}¦, adj., ppp., ({@1@}) {%understood, grasped%} (hardly a
Skt. usage; cf. however BR s.v. gam, ppp. gata, 1, l):
gatam etad Divy 301.27, {%I have understood this%} (which
you have said); etad api gatam 302.1, 5, 12; ({@2@}) exten-
sions of the quasi-suffixal use of gata noted for Skt. by
Whitney, Gr. 1273c; very close to the Skt. is perhaps
Divy 29.21 ekasya gṛhagataṃ kṣetragataṃ ca, ekasyā-
vārīgataṃ deśāntaragataṃ ca, {%to one went%} (in a division
of property) {%what was in the house and in the field%} (? or
possibly {%the house(s) and field(s)?%} as in dṛṣṭigata, rūpagata,
see below), etc.; Śikṣ 246.16 (tatra katamo 'bdhātuḥ ?)
yad idam asmin kāye 'dhyātmaṃ pratyātmam āpaḥ,
abgataṃ; aptvaṃ snehaḥ (abgataṃ perhaps {%what is%}
{%water%}), snehagataṃ snehatvaṃ…; on {@dṛṣṭi-gata@} and
{@rūpagata@}, which seem hardly distinguishable in mg. from
dṛṣṭi and rūpa, see s.vv. (the former is found in Pali,
the latter in AMg.).
