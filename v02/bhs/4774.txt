Mv ii.125.12, and similarly 126.17; 128.5; 129.7; see
discussion s.v. {@āśītakī@}; in parallel LV 254.8 kālāparvāṇi
(but most mss. omit), which agrees with the corresp. Pali
text kālāpabbāni MN i.80.12; 245.27, but the comm.
on the former reads kāḷa-pabbāni (as in Mv!) and repeats
the same form in its gloss (kāḷavalliyā vā saṃdhiṭṭhānesu);
it may mean the same plant designated as kālā in Skt.
