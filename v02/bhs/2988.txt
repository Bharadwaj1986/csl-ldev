{@ālokita-vilokita@}¦ (nt., dvandva; on Pali see below),
{%look and gaze%}; in a cliché, (prāsādikena…) °kitena Mv
i.301.6; iii.60.6; 182.12; in other forms of the same cliché
{@avalokita@} and {@vyavalokita@} are substituted; see these on
the Tib. interpretation of the difference of mg. between
them, to which I do not attach much importance (it
sounds etymologizing). However, acc. to Pali DN comm.
i.193.17 these two words mean {%looking ahead%} and {%looking%}
{%all around%}, which substantially = Tib.
