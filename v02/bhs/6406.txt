({@chāta@}¦, adj., {%thin%}; occurs, tho rarely, in Skt., as well
as Pkt. chāa, cf. Deśīn. 3.33, with comm.; Pischel 328;
Schmidt, Nachträge; acc. to Pischel, Pali chāta, Pkt.
chāa, {%hungry%}, is an unrelated word, from *psāta, while
our chāta is from *kṣāta; this theory seems speculative.
In Mv i.147.2 = 203.17 = ii.7.13 (vs) Senart em. cāpodare,
but read chātodare with all mss. in first and third citations
(in second nābhodare); cf. chātodarī in comm. to Deśīn.,
above; also Jm 3.8 kṣudhā chātatarodarīm.)
