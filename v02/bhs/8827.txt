{@pada@}¦ (= Pali id.), {%sentence, complete utterance%}, in
contrast with {@nāman@}, {%word%}, and {@vyañjana@}, {%sound%} (same
triad in Pali, PTSD s.v. pada, 4): Mvy 1998 (-kāyaḥ),
see s.v. {@kāya@} (2); defined AbhidhK. LaV-P. ii.238 as =
vākya, {%a complete statement which makes sense%}; this may
perhaps be the mg. in {@agra-pada@}; where the context
contains no contrasting word for {%word%}, that common
Skt. meaning of pada may ordinarily be assumed; see
s.v. {@vyañjana@} for one or two such passages where pada
is thus ambiguous ({%word%} or {%sentence%}).
