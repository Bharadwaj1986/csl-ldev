{@-pṛthakkārakam@}¦, adv., in siktha-pṛ°, {%separating the%}
{%lumps of rice%}: na…(we will eat) Mvy 8582; corresp. to
Pali sitthāvakārakaṃ, see CPD s.v. avakārakaṃ ({%‘scat-%}
{%tering about’%}). This is supported in sense by Prāt 534.1
which is printed śista-vikiraṃ, with note: ‘Corr. śiṣṭa’;
Chin. {%sans jeter des morceaux%}; it seems clear that either
the MIndic (Pali) sittha, or a Sktized (perh. hyper-Skt.)
form of it, was intended; Chin. suggests this rather than
śiṣṭa, {%what is left%}.
