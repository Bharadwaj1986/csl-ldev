{@vilekhya@}¦, m., Mvy 5235 °yaḥ, defined in Tib. and
<div n="lb">Chin. as {%regret%} or {%impressing on the mind, paying careful%}
<div n="lb">{%heed%}; same definition for {@ālekhya@} (or {@°kha@}), {@vipratisāra@},
<div n="lb">and {@kaukṛtya@}, 5234, 5236, 5237. Obviously related to
<div n="lb">{@vilekha@}, which is recorded as v.l. in both edd. of Mvy
<div n="lb">and should perhaps be read for this.
