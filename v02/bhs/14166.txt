{@vilekhya@}¦, m., Mvy 5235 °yaḥ, defined in Tib. and
Chin. as {%regret%} or {%impressing on the mind, paying careful%}
{%heed%}; same definition for {@ālekhya@} (or {@°kha@}), {@vipratisāra@},
and {@kaukṛtya@}, 5234, 5236, 5237. Obviously related to
{@vilekha@}, which is recorded as v.l. in both edd. of Mvy
and should perhaps be read for this.
