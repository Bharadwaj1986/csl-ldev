{@kaśambaka-jāta@}¦ (also written kaṣ°, kas°; = Pali
kasambu-jāta, with var. kasambuka-j°), acc. to Tib. on
Mvy, {%rotten%}; this is consistent with the lit. mg. in Pali,
applied to a tree the inside of which is rotten, see s.v.
{@avasruta@}; the orig. mg. was forgotten in Pali at an early
time, as the vague and inconsistent Pali comms. show;
e.g. Vin. ii.236.26, comm. 1287.5 = ākiṇṇadosataya
saṃkiliṭṭhajātaṃ; Pugg.p. 27.10, comm. 207.25 either
kasambu = kacavara, {%rubbish%}, or = tinta-kuṇapa-gataṃ
kasaṭa-udakaṃ (evidently guessing): Mvy 9139 kaṣ° (but
Mironov kaś°) = Tib. śiṅ rul ba ({%rotten%}) lta bur gyur pa;
[Page174-b+ 71]
follows antarpūty avasrutaḥ (all part of a longer cliché
found repeatedly in Pali, e.g. in Vin. and Pugg.p., ll.cc.);
MSV i.50.7 kaṣ°; Śikṣ 67.20 kaśambakajāto aśramaṇaḥ
etc. (as in Mvy 9143--4); AsP 181.20 kas°. Could this
word be related to kasavva Deśīn. 2.53, said to have
four mgs., (1) stokam, (2) ārdram, {%wet%}, (3) pracuraṃ,
(4) bāṣpaḥ? By the ‘law of morae’ kasamba could be
related to Deśī kasavva.
