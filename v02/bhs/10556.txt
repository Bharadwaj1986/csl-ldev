{@pravyāhṛtavatī@}¦, Av ii.10.9, following uvāca (fem.
subject), can, it seems, only be a periphrastic form sub-
stituting for the perfect, from Skt. pravyāharati, {%speaks%};
render, {%she spoke and uttered%} (the following, which directly
quotes her speech). Feer, {%s'écria à haute voix%}; Speyer,
Index, does not translate, but attributes ‘inchoative force’
to pra (i.e. {%began to speak?%}); this is not supported by Skt.
or BHS usage as far as I know.
