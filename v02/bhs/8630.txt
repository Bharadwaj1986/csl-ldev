{@Nīla-kāyika@}¦, n. of a class of gods, noted only in
LV 383.9 °kair devaputrair, and 11 {@Vairocano@} (q.v., 7)
nāma Nīlakāyiko devaputraḥ. I have been unable to find
anything more about this term. Tib. renders sṅon po
({%blue%}) ris ({%form, figure%}; also {%party%}, like BHS {@kāya@}). This
suggests that Tib. understood {%belonging to the group of%}
{%Nīla (blue) ones%}, rather than {%blue-bodied%}. In LV they,
and their spokesman Vairocana, seem to be superior to
the four {@mahārāja@} gods.
