{@adhyāvara@}¦, m. (= Pali ajjhāvara), {%associate, atten-%}
{%dant, member of retinue%}: adhyāvarā (acc. pl.; so all mss.,
Lefm. em. °carā) kṛtvana sarvadevān LV 395.9 (vs),
{%having made all gods my associates%}. CPD and PTSD suggest
emending the Pali form, also, to ajjhācara. But the two
forms confirm each other and must surely be kept, what-
ever the etymology of this rare and obscure word may be.
