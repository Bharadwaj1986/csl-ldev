{@Ārāḍa@}¦ (also {@Arāḍa@}, q.v., and see next; = Pali
Āḷāra), n. of a sage under whom Śākyamuni studied for
a time; in a dvandva cpd. Ārāḍodraka (-Udraka) Divy
392.1 (see also under {@Arāḍa@} and {@Ārāḍaka@}); generally
surnamed Kālāma (= Pali id.): °ḍa-Kāl° as one word
Mvy 3515, but regularly two words: Mv ii.118.1 ff.;
198.1; iii.322.15, 17; in LV 238.14, 19 f.; 239.6, 12; 403.20;
404.2--3, 3--4, Lefmann reads the surname always Kālāpa;
the mss. generally vary, in 404.3 all have Kālāma. How-
ever, there seems to have been some support in northern
tradition for the ending -pa, for Tib. on Mvy and LV
renders sgyu rtsal śes (byed), {%knowing arts%}, which seems
to point to analysis into kalā plus a form of root āp-.
