{@śyāma-śavala@}¦ (Senart's em., mss. {@śāma-@}, semi-
MIndic, or soma-, intending sāma-, MIndic), pl., {%dogs%}:
(so pi agninā dagdho mahānarake) upapanno °lehi aho-
rātrāṇi khādyati Mv iii.361.15, {%born in hell, is eaten by%}
{%dogs%} (? see below) {%day and night%}. This old Vedic dvandva
cpd., there used of the dogs of Yama, is not otherwise
clearly used in the mg. {%dog%}. The comm. to Hāla (Weber)
vss 185 and 211 knows a vrata called śyāma-(also śāma,
sāma-)-śavala (also -sa°), which has something to do with
fire and water; whether it is to be equated with kukkura-
vrata implied by BHS {@°vratika@}, q.v., seems doubtful;
Weber assumes that it refers to the two dogs of Yama,
but admits inability to explain the term. In Pali sāma
and sabala are used as adj. with soṇa, {%dog%} (so correctly
comm.) Jāt. vi.106.21, and as names of two dogs in the
Lokantara hell Jāt. vi.247.16; barely possibly, the Mv
may mean the word as a dvandva, two nn. pr.
