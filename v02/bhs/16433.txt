{@? sarvatraka@}¦, adj. (cf. Pali sabbatthaka, {%universal,%}
{%in all places%}, not in the BHS mg. in Jāt. i.172.1 or Dāṭh.
5.57; two other refs. in PTSD not found, app. erroneous),
{%capable of going everywhere%}: vimānāni °kāni Mv ii.177.15
(prose); no v.l., but the mg. is suspiciously like that of
Skt. sarvatra-ga, which perh. read, if the word really
modifies the preceding vimānāni. However, the following
words are sarvakālikāni puṣpaphalāni, and the position
of our word suggests a corruption for Skt. sarvartukāni,
{%of all seasons%}; equivalents of this word (see {@sarvārtuka,@}
{@sarvotuka@}) precede {@sarvakālika@}, q.v., in Mv ii.97.4;
iii.69.12, 13.
