Pali), see {@upādāna@} (sometimes rendered {%perception%}); when
the Bodhisattva sat down at the bodhi-tree, he received
(pratilabhati) at once five saṃjñā, {%ideas%} or {%impressions%},
viz. kṣema-s°, sukha-, śubha-, hita-, and (fifthly) adya

404.17--19, where the fifth is substantially the same, the
others being atīta-s°, kṣema-, sukha-, aśakya- (neither
passage explains the first four); aśubha-saṃjñā (= Pali
asubha-saññā), {%conceptions of foul things%} which must be
meditated on by monks, see s.v. {@aśubha-bhāvanā@}; often
