{@āśvāsa-praśvāsa@}¦ (Pali assāsa-passāsa), m. dual or
pl., {%breath%}; usually used without clear indication of dif-
ference between the two terms, like {@ānāpāna@}, q.v.: LV
251.15--16 nāsikātaś cāśvāsapraśvāsāv uparuddhāv abhū-
tāṃ; 252.3 °sā ūrdhvaṃ śiraḥkapālam upanighnanti sma;
as separate words, 259.7 āśvāsaviprahīnaḥ praśvāsa-
varjitu; Mv ii.124.10 (and ff.) mukhato nāsikāśrotrehi ca
āśvāsapraśvāsā uparundhi (1 sg. aor.); Mv iii.179.19 °sehi
tathāgataṃ upahanati; Śāl 78.3, 17 kāyasyāśvāsapraśvā-
sakṛtyaṃ; Sādh 61.19 °sādikam; the verb {@uśvasati@}, q.v.,
[Page110-b+ 71]
corresponds to āśvāsa in Mv ii.208.3--4 āśvāsapraśvāsā
uparuddhā…no pi uśvasati na praśvasati (the two verbs
repeated twice in lines 8, 9), cf. LV 189.12 ucchvasantaṃ
praśvasantam, rendered by Tib. dbugs dbyuṅ zhiṅ rṅub
{%breathing out and in%}, but in line 15 below praśvasantaḥ
is rendered dbugs dbyuṅ, {%breathing out%} (implying that
ucchvasantaṃ was understood as {%breathing in%}); {@ucchvāsa-@}
{@praśvāso@} (sg.) also occurs, seemingly = āśvāsa-pra°,
Śikṣ 42.5; in Sādh 146.17 ff. it is entirely certain that
praśvāsa is understood as {%outbreathing%} and āśvāsa {%inbreath-%}
{%ing%}, tadanu tan mithunaṃ praśvāsavāyurathārūḍhaṃ
nāsikāvivareṇa niḥsṛtya…sattvānāṃ kāyavākcittāni vi-
śodhya gṛhītvā ca punar āśvāsavāyum āruhya tenaiva
pathā svahṛtkamalakarṇikāyāṃ praviśet; consistent with
this is AMg. ussāsa (and relatives), which BHS usage
would clearly have associated with āśvāsa, and which acc.
to Ratnach. means {%breathing in%}; Pali tradition is indeter-
minate, see Vism i.272.1 which states that Vin. comm.
defines assāsa as {%outgoing%}, passāsa as {%incoming%} breath, but
that in Sutta comms. (Suttantaṭṭhakathāsu) the reverse
is taught (the passage is misunderstood by PTSD and
Pe Maung Tin; uppaṭipāṭiyā = Pkt. upparivāḍi, {%inverted,%}
{%transposed%}). Tib. regularly āśvasati = dbugs brṅubs (or
cognate) {%breathe in%} Mvy 1173, 1175, etc., praśvasati =
dbugs phyuṅ (or cognate) {%breathe out%} Mvy 1174, 1176,
etc.; it therefore supports Sādh 146.17 ff., and incidentally
the equation of āśvāsa with āna and praśvāsa with apāna
(see {@ānāpāna@}). How old this interpretation is remains
uncertain, esp. in view of the fact that in Pali the comms.
differed; Buddhaghosa himself, in the Vism. passage cited,
declines to arbitrate between the two opposing views.
Whatever may have been the meaning of the two terms,
it seems clear that the cpd. (like {@ānāpāna@}) was commonly
used in the sense of {%breath%}, collectively and as a whole.
