{@Tantrī@}¦, n. of a daughter of Māra acc. to Mv iii.281.15;
283.15; 284.3; 286.6. The Mv is clearly secondary here;
thruout most of the passage it mentions only two daughters
of Māra, Tantrī and Arati, but in 286.6 three, the third
being Rati. Originally (LV 378.4 ff.; Pali, see Childers
s.v. Ragā) there were three, Tṛṣṇā, Arati, and Rati (or,
in Pali, Ragā, SN i.124.15 ff.). It is clear that Mv replaces
Tṛṣṇā by Tantrī. Could it be a corruption of MIndic
*Taṇhī = BHS {@tṛṣṇī@}, q.v. ? Or is the corruption based
on some form of the numeral for {%three%} (which is lost in
Mv except in the final verse), cf. tās tisro…LV 378.4 ?
