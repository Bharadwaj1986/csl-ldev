{%a kind of drum%}; prob. read so with Kashgar rec. twice for
both edd. maṇḍaka (vv.ll. Nep. mss. madduka, maḍaka,
etc.; note in KN says ‘probably to read maḍḍukā’ which
is also cited in Skt. Lex. in same mg.) in SP 52.1 (vs),
KN vādāpitā…yehi (Śikṣ yehī) jala-maṇḍakā vāpy-atha
maṇḍakā vā, cited thus (except yehī) in Śikṣ 93.(11--)12;
WT {@carpaṭa-@}, q.v., for vāpy-atha, no other change; Tib.
for the pāda, chu la brdabs daṅ thal mo brdabs pa daṅ,
apparently {%striking on water and striking on the palms of%}
{%the hands%}. That some instrument, presumably of percus-
sion, was meant seems clear from vādāpitā, tho I find no
record of such a mg. for Tib. brdabs. These noises were
made in honor of relics of Buddhas.
