{@parijūna@}¦, adj. (= Skt. paridyūna; Pali parijunna,
Ud. ii.7; cf. {@paridyāna@}; not *parijūrṇa, {%old%}, as assumed
by Childers, PTSD, and evidently Senart), {%wretched,%}
[Page323-a+ 71]
{%miserable, poor%}; also {@parijūnya@} (nt., abstr. from prec.;
once written in one ms. °juñña, in MIndic fashion), {%weak-%}
{%ness, debility, poverty%} (Pali has the noun pārijuñña, nt.;
the same four kinds as in Mv are listed in MN ii.66.9 ff.;
the Pkt. adj. parijuṇṇa, °junna, is defined by Sheth {%weak,%}
{%poor%}, durbala, daridra, nirdhana, and doubtless belongs
with this word): read in Mv ii.161.14--15 na…bodhi-
sattvo jarāparijūnyena parijūno…abhiniṣkramati; in
17…vyādhiparijūnyena (one ms. here °juññena) pari°…;
in 19…bhogapari° pari°…; in 162.3…jñātipari°
pari°…; the mss. are corrupt in all these, but in 17 and
19 one of them is nearly right, reading °parijūtena parijūto
or °parijūnena parijūno.
