{@jina-śrāvaka@}¦, {%pupil of a jina%}, applied in Mv ii.118.2,
3 to the pupils of Ārāḍa Kālāma, and in ii.119.9, 10 to
those of Udraka Rāmaputra. Senart assumes that this
means that these teachers were Jains. But in default
of any other evidence this seems unlikely; jina is of course
also a title of a Buddha, and we may infer from this that
it could be applied to the founder of any religious sect.
