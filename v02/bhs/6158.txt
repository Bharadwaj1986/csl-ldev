{@caryā@}¦ (Skt.) = {@cari@}, q.v., used like that form (regu-
larly in prose, but also in verses) esp. of the {%course of%}
{%conduct%} of Bodhisattvas, which has four aspects or stages:
catvārīmāni bodhisattvānāṃ bodhisattvacaryāṇi Mv i.1.2,
listed in 3 as prakṛti-caryā, praṇidhāna-c°, {@anuloma-c°@},
anivartana-c° (cf. Senart i p. xxi); same list, called cata-
sraḥ…bodhisattvacaryāḥ i.46.6; they are discussed in
the following 46.8 ff. (prakṛti-c° 46.8--47.11; praṇidhi-c°
47.12--63.10; anuloma- and avivarta-c°, very briefly,
63.11--14); they seem to be aspects, or possibly successive
stages, of the Bodhisattva's long course of development;
prakṛti- refers to his original, basic endowment; praṇi-
dhāna- (°dhi-) to his vows to attain enlightenment;
anuloma- (also ānulomikī, see s.v. ānulomika) alludes to
his progressive approach to the goal, and anivartana-
(avivarta-) refers to the point at which it becomes im-
possible for him to backslide. We also find bodhicaryā(ṇi,
with nt. ending, as above) Mv i.252.4, °ryāṃ ii.341.1
(both of these vss), and duṣkara-caryāṃ ii.241.4 (prose),
parallel to bodhi-cari and duṣkara-cari.See further {@artha-@}
{@caryā, dharma-caryā@}.
