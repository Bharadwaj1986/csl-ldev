{@dvādaśavargīya@}¦, f. {@°yā@}, pl., {%belonging to a group of%}
{%twelve%} (nuns; clearly not {%heretics%} as stated in Index):
°yābhiḥ śrutam Divy 493.12; °yābhir 495.23. No such
group has been discovered in Pali; the context in Divy
is my only source of knowledge of the meaning. It can
hardly mean {%members of the dvādaśavarga%}, q.v., in the sense
of {%quorum for ordination%}. Apparently these nuns were
given to cavilling and trouble-making; they object to
functions assigned to (Cūḍa-)Panthaka.
