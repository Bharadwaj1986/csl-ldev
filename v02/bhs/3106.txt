{@āhāraka@}¦, m., in Mvy 3851, acc. to Tib. sñod ciṅ
stobs pa, which seems to mean someone concerned with
food; so also Chin. Prob. this is etymological guesswork
(Skt. āhāra). Certainly it refers to some member of a ship's
crew; see {@āhāra, āharaṇa@}; perhaps {%one who tows%} (or
otherwise propels?) {%a boat%}, as in Pali āharitvā (nāvaṃ)
Jāt. iv.159.16.
