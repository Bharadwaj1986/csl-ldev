{@? parisaṃsthita@}¦ (ppp. of pari-saṃ-sthā, of which
no other form seems to be recorded except the caus.,
see prec., and Pali parisaṃṭhāti, in a very different mg.;
°sthita occurs once in Mbh.Crit. ed. 1.114.59 in mg.
{%standing round about%}, of attendant deities; AMg. pari-
saṃṭhiya, {%well-established%}, Ratnach.), {%established%}: (iyaṃ
sarvāvatī lokadhātū…) apagatanadīmahānadī parisaṃ-
sthitā SP 244.12 (prose; ed. fails to separate from the
prec. word). But perhaps the caus. parisaṃsthāpitā (see
prec.) should be read with WT; no ms. is reported with
it but some mss. have caus. forms, and the parallel 246.7
looks in this direction.
