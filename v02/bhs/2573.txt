{@āgraha@}¦ (presumably m.; cf. {@āgṛhīta@}), {%niggardliness,%}
{%holding back%} (from giving): SP 257.1 (after long description
of how the Bodhisattva gave away everything, even his
life) na ca me kadācid āgrahacittam utpannam, {%and I%}
{%never conceived a thought of holding back%} (wrongly Burnouf
and Kern); Av i.174.5 (vs; after 4 nādattvā paribhuñjīran
na syur matsariṇas tathā,) na caiṣām āgrahe cittam utpa-
dyeta kadācana, {%and there would never arise for them a%}
{%thought of holding back%} (from giving). As Speyer points
out in his Index to Av, KSS 90.22 probably contains the
word āgraheṇa {%with niggardliness, holding back from giving%};
but this mg. has not been recognized; the ordinary Skt.
usage is not quite the same.
