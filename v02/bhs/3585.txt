{@? udyojayati@}¦ (see also s.v. {@udyoṭita@}), acc. to Bendall
and Rouse, Śikṣ Transl. 57 note 1, = Pali uyyojeti,
{%dismisses, sends away%}: Śikṣ 56.2 yāvad dhārmaśravaṇikāś
codyojayitavyāḥ parṣanmaṇḍalaṃ parisaṃsthāpayitav-
yam; but Tib. brtson par ḥgyur, = (to be) {%made zealous%},
the regular Skt. mg.; yāvad can be understood as {%up to%}
{%the point%} (in the text where it is said--), thus fitting this
mg., and B. and R.'s interpretation seems implausible.
[Page132-a+ 71]
They assume the same mg. for Mv iii.141.12 (bhagavān
…asuranayutāni…samyaksaṃbodhīye vyākaritvā
bahūni ca prāṇisahasrāṇi āryadharmeṣu pratiṣṭhāpayitvā
rājānaṃ śuddhodanaṃ ca) saparivāraṃ ca udyojaye; but
here too this verb (mss. udyojeya or °yaṃ) may well
mean {%aroused, inspired%}, as regularly in Skt.; this accords
well with the preceding parts of the sentence, and seems
more natural than {%dismissed%} (tho Ś. and his followers did
in fact depart, as the next sentence says).
