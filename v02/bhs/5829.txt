[{@gṛhīṇa@}¦, RP 29.11 (vs), taken by Finot, p. X, line 5,
as n. sg. = Skt. gṛhī; I think we should emend to gṛhī
na. Read: gṛddho gṛhī na tathā kāmair yādṛśe pravrajitva
te gṛddhāḥ, {%a householder is not so eager for pleasures as%}
{%they are eager, after becoming monks%} (said of wicked and
degenerate monks).]
