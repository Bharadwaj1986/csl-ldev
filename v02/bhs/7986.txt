{@? dhyuṣita@}¦, adj., ep. of garments or cloth, acc. to pw
{%blendend weiss%}: cīvarāni (so) °tāni Kv 78.22; °ta-paṭam
81.7, see s.v. {@indra-paṭa@}. There is a very dubious record
of a Skt. n. pr. Dhyuṣitāśva, BR, but this is prob. incorrect.
The word paṭa is often preceded in comp. by duṣya- or
dūṣya-, designating {%a very fine cloth%}, and I am inclined
to read this; the text of Kv is so corrupt that it seems
not implausible.
