{@parindāmi@}¦ (also {@parī°, anu-par°@}, qq.v.; peculiar to
BHS; formation unexplained, see below), {%I present, hand%}
{%over%}: °āmi SP 410.10; 484.5; LV 443.9 (Lefm. paridāmy,
read with v.l. parind°); ppp. parindita, see {@Parinditārtha@},
and Pargiter ap. Hoernle MR p. 179, where parindita is
read for parī° Vaj 20.4, 10. Could nasalized vowel -in-
(-iṃ) be a substitute by the ‘law of Morae’ for parī-dāmi
(cf. ppp. parītta), and the forms with parīnd° be blends?
Not satisfactory. But parī- occurs for pari-. Dr. Paul
Tedesco would derive by the Morengesetz from *pariddāmi
for paridadāmi with loss of -a-; as a parallel he cites Skt.
ujjhāmi etc., which he also derives directly from uj-jahāmi
with loss of -a-. That ujjh- is somehow derived from ud
plus root hā, few will doubt; but I am not sure that this
is the precise way (for a different one see Uhlenbeck s.v.);
and I should like other examples of such loss of -a-.
