{@samādāpayati@}¦, also (in vss, perh. m.c., but cf. {@°da-@}
{@paka, °dapana@}, and Pali) {@°dapeti@}, q.v. (= Pali samāda-
peti, no °dāpeti recorded; primarily caus. to {@samādiyati@}
in Pali and BHS), ({@1@}) {%causes to assume, to take upon one-%}
{%self%}, usually a moral or religious duty: °yati Mvy 6833 =
Tib. yaṅ dag par (= sam) ḥdzin (or byed) du ḥjug, {%cause%}
{%to take%} or {%to do%}; personal object, if expressed, regularly
acc.; impersonal object, that which the personal object
is incited to take on himself, may be acc., (bodhisattva-
yānam eva) °yati SP 71.10 (prose), (the Buddha) {%incites%}
{%to take on the B.-vehicle only%}; but much oftener ({@2@}) {%incites%}
(to), with loc., which seems to imply weakening of the
orig. lit. mg.: te codārāyāṃ buddhabodhau °pitāḥ SP
110.7; (aśrāddhaṃ…śraddhāsaṃpadi) °yati Divy 51.28
(and f.); Bbh 222.12 (and f.); dāne cainān °yati Bbh 4.23;
parāṃs tatra kuśale °yati Bbh 270.21; mahājanakāyaṃ
buddhānusmṛtau °paya Av i.82.3; this is the regular con-
struction and is very common; sometimes the thing
instigated (to) is not a religious or moral duty, as in Divy
57.17, (Śakra says to a king: yadi kaścic) cyavanadharmā
devaputro bhaviṣyati, tat te putratve °payiṣyāmi,…{%I%}
{%will instigate him to become your son%}, and so, (mayā tvaṃ
Praṇādasya rājño putratve) °pito 59.5; ({@3@}) rarely with
instr., {%causes%} or {%urges to become endowed with…%}: pañcahi
śikṣāpadehi °paye (aor.) Mv i.321.18; rājānaṃ…bodhi-
karakair dharmaiḥ °yati Av i.69.12; ({@4@}) without formal
expression of that to which one is {%instigated%}; may be
rendered {%inspires, excites%}, but context always indicates a
religious or moral purpose: tān sarvasattvān °payet SP
347.8; esp. in a cliché (also in Pali, e.g. DN ii.42.8 dham-
miyā kathāya saṃdassesi samādapesi samuttejesi saṃpa-
haṃsesi), dharmyayā kathayā (or equivalent forms) saṃ-
darśayati samādāpayati samuttejayati saṃpraharṣayati
(or with other forms of these verbs), {%with a religious dis-%}
{%course showed%} (expounded, explained to, instructed),
{%incited, inflamed, delighted%}, Divy 80.18; 85.1; Av i.63.8;
Bbh 106.22 ff.; LV 38.14 (text corrupt, read with v.l.
saṃdarsya samādāpya etc.); 67.18; Mv i.309.2; 322.7;
329.14; iii.55.16; 143.6; 272.11, et passim; in SP 309.5
saṃ-darś- is omitted; ({@5@}) twice seems used in mg. of the
simplex {@samādiyati@}, {%assumes, takes on oneself%} (duties):
in Mv i.321.20 (after 18, Kāśyapo Jyotipālaṃ…pañcahi
śikṣāpadehi samādāpaye, Jyotipāla replies: na) tāvad
ahaṃ…sarvāṇi pañca śikṣāpadāni °payiṣyaṃ, {%I shall not%}
{%assume all the five observances%}; cf. in the sequel, 322.5,
eṣo 'haṃ…pañca śikṣāpadāni samādiyāmi, the expected
[Page568-b+ 71]
form; and so in Suv 6.11 (yāvad) daśakuśalamūlakarma-
pathaṃ samādāpayet seems to mean {%until he acquired%}
{%(succeeded in assuming) the…%}; subject is Śākyamuni in
past existences; no personal object of the seemingly caus.
verb, and the context does not seem to favor {%until he%}
{%induced creatures%} (cf. sattvānāṃ, line 12) {%to assume…%};
Tib. also makes it non-caus., yaṅ dag par blaṅs par gyur,
{%come to be receiving%}, or blaṅs te gnas par gyur, {%receiving,%}
{%come to remain (so)%}.
