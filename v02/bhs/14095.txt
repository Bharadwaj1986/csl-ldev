({@vimāna@}¦, nt. and m., = Skt. id.; on use in Pali,
see elaborate article in PTSD; even in Skt., see BR, it is
not exclusively used of divine, nor yet of mobile, residences,
but may apply to any luxurious dwelling-place, which
in India would naturally include the surrounding grounds;
see Mrs. Rhys Davids, Minor Anthologies of the Pali
Canon Part IV, 1942, p. vi: ‘…more than houses, in-
cluding gardens, woods, lakes’ etc… ‘{%estates%} might have
been more literally correct’, but she uses {%mansions%}; several
times in Jm the word is applied to something located in
woods and used by a king for amusement; Speyer {%arbors%},
pw 7.375 ‘etwa {%Hain’%}, but surely buildings seem to be
involved: vimāna-deśeṣu Jm 182.22, 183.3; the king takes
a siesta śrīmati °na-pradeśe 183.10; the king stays for a
time śrīmati pravivikte °na-deśe 192.23; vane manoharo-
dyāna-°na-bhūṣite 208.20. Pali certainly also uses the
word, as does Skt. more commonly, of the air-traveling
palaces of the gods; and I question whether either Pali
or BHS gives it any meaning which could not be matched
in Skt. On Divy 399.18, where pw also sees the meaning
{%Hain%}, see {@Śairīṣaka@}; nothing in the context suggests any
reason for departure from the common meaning, {%celestial%},
and no doubt {%mobile, palace%}.)
