{@-prajñāyate@}¦, denom. from -prajñā, in jāti-prajñāyate
jarā-pr° vyādhi-pr° maraṇa-pr° LV 19.12 (prose), {%there is%}
{%knowledge of birth, old age, disease, death%}; based on cpd.
jāti-prajñā, etc. Weller 18 wrongly assumes that jāti etc.
are separate nouns, n. sg., and prajñāyate pass.; this is
the construction in Mv i.52.10 jarā vyādhi maraṇaṃ (so
mss.; Senart as one dvandva cpd., em. °maraṇā) ca
prajñāyanti, {%old age, disease, and death become known%}.
In prose of LV it is hardly conceivable that jāti, vyādhi,
and maraṇa would occur in one sentence as n. sg.; while
in prose of Mv vyādhi is not at all surprising as n. sg.
