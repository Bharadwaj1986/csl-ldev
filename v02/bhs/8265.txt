{@nipaka, (1)@}¦ m., {%chief%} (cf. Jain Skt. nipa, doubtless
semi-Skt. for AMg. ṇiva = Skt. nṛpa, Ind. Stud. 14.386):
Divy 447.27; 451.20; ({@2@}) adj., = Pali id., in Pali tradition
app. always interpreted as {%wise, prudent%}, and so nepakka,
{%wisdom, prudence%}; occurs in Ud several times, mostly in
vss which also occur in Pali with the same word, viz.
vi.8; xii.18; xiv.13, 14; xv.6 (here text nṛpaka, not cor-
rected in ed.; if genuine, could only be hyper-Sktism;
the Pali vs, It. 47.3, has nipako); in all these occurrences
{%zealous%} (see 3 below) would make quite as good sense;
({@3@}) in phrase nipakasyāṅgasaṃbhāraiḥ Mvy 7023 and
Bbh 145.23, {%with the collection of parts of the nipaka%} (man)?
Acc. to Tib. on Mvy, ḥgru skyaṅ, {%zealously attending (?),%}
{%zealous%}, and so Chin. on Mvy appears to take nipaka;
Wogihara's Index to Bbh renders it by two Chin. characters
which may mean {%constantly self-possessed%} (possibly associat-
ing the word with Pali niya, niyaka, = Skt. nija, {%own?%}).
It would be possible to identify this occurrence of the
word with mg. 2; it might mean {%prudent, wise%}, here; or
contrariwise the occurrences under 2 might mean {%zealous%}.
Further complication is caused by {@niyaka@}, which Tib.
seems to interpret as the same as nipaka, suggesting
graphic confusion; this is proposed in the Index to Mvy
and in pw 7.352, where niyaka is assumed to stand for
nipaka and the mg. {%wise%} is given for both Mvy passages,
but doubtfully for the one here under discussion.
