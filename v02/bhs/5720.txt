{@Giri@}¦, n. of a nāga-king (cf. next): Māy 246.32. In
LV 393.3 (vs) I am doubtful of -giri-, which seems to stand
for a form of gir(ā), {%speech, words%}, and suggest em. to -gira-,
m.c. for -girā, see prec. Text apagata-giri-vākpatho hy
alipto, said of the Buddha: {%unstained, because beyond the%}
{%range of speech in words%}; in Skt. (atīta-)vākpatha (not well
defined in BR) means {%(beyond) the range of words, inexpressi-%}
{%ble, indescribable%}; some such meaning must be involved
here. Mss. vākyatho, but Tib., otherwise not clear, confirms
a form of -path(a): tshig bral dag gi lam (= {%way%}) gyis
(inst.; does this point to a reading -pathā?) mi gos pa,
which seems to mean {%not stained by the way of those deprived%}
{%of speech%}. But Calc. and Foucaux understand apagatagiri
as a separate word (loc. absolute), which may be right.
