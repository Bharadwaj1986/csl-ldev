{@tasarikā@}¦ (from Skt. tasara, {%shuttle%}), in Divy 83.24
(prose), acc. to Index {%weaving%}, as {%operation of the shuttle%};
this force of the suffix would seem peculiar, but the con-
text gives little help: (Śacy api…) tasarikāṃ kartum
ārabdhā. In the preceding sentence Śakra, in disguise,
vastraṃ vāyitum ārabdhaḥ. Perhaps tasarikāṃ kartum,
{%to make the%} (little) {%shuttle%}, means only {%to operate the shuttle%}.
