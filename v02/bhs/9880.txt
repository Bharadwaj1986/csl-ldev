[{@prajanīyām@}¦, 1 sg. opt., in Śikṣ 283.10 (sarvasattvā-
nām…) svacittacaritāni pra°; read instead prajānīyām,
{%of all creatures may I learn to know the own thoughts and%}
{%conduct%}; cf. line 9 (ekaikasyāpi) sattvasya cittacaritaṃ
jānīyām. Bendall and Rouse, 259, interpret as if from
pra-jana(ya)ti, {%produce%}; this is most implausible on formal
(linguistic) as well as philological grounds; it assumes an
unbelievable opt. of a thematic verb which does not exist
in Skt. (only pass. prajāyate, °ti) or Pali.]
