{@vadya@}¦ (nt. ? = Pali vajja, which is usually derived
from Skt. varjya, tho this is not used as a noun in this
sense; if so, vadya would be a false Sktization of vajja,
as in next), {%fault, sin%}: (read) aṇumātreṣu vadyeṣu bhaya-
darśāvī Mv iii.52.1 = Pali aṇumattesu vajjesu bhayadas-
sāvī (see CPD s.v. aṇumatta), {%seeing danger in%} (even)
{%very small faults%}; a common phrase in Pali; since Pali
vajja is common in other locutions, there seems no doubt
that we must read vadyeṣu; mss. corrupt, °mātreṣevadyeṣu
or °mātreṣvabandheṣu; Senart em. °mātreṣv āvadyeṣu
(intending Skt. avadyeṣu? this would seem plausible but
for the close Pali parallel).
