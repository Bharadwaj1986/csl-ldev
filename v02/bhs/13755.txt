{@vijñā@}¦ (cf. AMg. a-viṇṇā; no such noun seems recorded
in Skt. or Pali), {%discretion, mature intelligence%}, in vijñā-
prāpta or vijña° (with MIndic shortening before cons.
cluster? § 9.6), {%arrived at years of discretion%}, of a child
reaching maturity: ṛṣikumāro vijña- Mv ii.211.18 (prose;
v.l. vijñā-); iii.145.8 (here mss. both āvijña°); yadā vijñā-
prāpto 'smi iii.131.12 (no v.l.); sā dārikā vijñaprāptā 156.4
(no v.l.); yatra kāle vivṛddhā vijñaprāptā 184.6 (no v.l.);
all prose. Since {@prāpta@}, q.v., may be preceded in comp.
by an adj., we might assume the Skt. adj. vijña as prior
member here; but the occurrence of vijñā- makes this
doubtful.
