[{@kruhi@}¦, Mv i.280.14 and ii.405.15, so Senart with
mss.; but read brūmi in both. Note that mss. at ii.405.15
point to (a)ham as subject. In a number of other places
the Mv mss. read kruhi or krumi (ii.50.2, 12; 51.2, 12; 52.2;
181.16; 193.10; 256.15; 294.13; 482.12; iii.17.18; 214.4),
but Senart always em. brūhi or brūmi; also in i.307.1 mss.
krutha, Senart em. brutha, intending brūtha. Sometimes
a corresponding Pali passage proves the emendation right,
e.g. Mv iii.214.4 = DN ii.242.16 brūhi; Mv ii.50.2 = Jāt.
v.387.21 vadāmi (Mv brūmi). In my opinion Senart should
have made a clean sweep of these erroneous forms and
adopted brūmi in i.280.14 and ii.405.15.]
