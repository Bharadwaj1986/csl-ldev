{@avadya-bhīru@}¦, {%dreading%} (and shunning) {%reproach%}
(blame, evil, sin), ep. of the family into which a Bodhisattva
is born in his last existence: Mv i.198.1; ii.1.11; LV 24.4.
All these are forms of the same passage; in LV text anava-
dya-, with v.l. avadya-; in Mv ii.1.11 Senart reads anava-
dya, tho he recognizes at i p. 532 that the corrupt mss.
point rather to avadya-, which he reads with mss. at
i.198.1. The reading avadya- is confirmed by Tib. on LV
kha na ma tho bas (= avadya, see Das s.v.) ḥjigs pa
(= bhīru). Note the noun avadya-bhī RV 10.107.3 (isolated).
