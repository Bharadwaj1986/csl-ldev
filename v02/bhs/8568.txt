{@niṣpadi@}¦ (m.c. for °dī ? = {@niṣpad@}, and Skt. niṣpatti;
Sheth cites a Pkt. ṇippaddi [!possibly read ṇippadi?]
by the side of ṇippatti and ṇipphatti), {%production, attain-%}
{%ment, accomplishment%}: tasya mi niṣpadi bheṣyati adya
LV 287.8, 10 = Tib. de ni de riṅ ṅa la ḥgrub par ḥgyur,
{%that today for me at accomplishment arrives%}. It seems that
niṣpadi must be a nom. sg.; this seems confirmed by
287.6 where Lefm. prints the same reading, but Tib. has
thob par, {%obtaining, getting%}, = prāpti, instead of ḥgrub
[Page309-a+ 71]
par = niṣpadi, thus confirming the v.l. of the best mss.
prāpti bhaviṣyati instead of niṣpadi bheṣyati; it would
be very forced, in view of n. sg. prāpti (and for other
reasons), to see anything but a n. sg. in niṣpadi.
