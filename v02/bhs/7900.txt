<L>7900<pc>284,1<k1>धातृ<k2>धातृ = धात्री
{@dhātṛ = dhātrī@}¦, {%nurse%}: mātṛbhir dhātṛbhiś (both
edd., no v.l.) ca rudantībhiḥ parivṛtāḥ SP 160.14 (prose),
{%surrounded by their weeping mothers and nurses%}. The form
has phonetic aspects (§ 3.95) but may and doubtless
should be regarded as in part, and perhaps primarily, a
riming adaptation to the preceding mātṛbhiḥ.
