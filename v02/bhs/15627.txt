{@? saṃcaukṣa@}¦, adj., {%completely pure%}: tadgṛhaṃ °ṣaṃ
kṛtvā…dātavyam Suv 118.4--5 (prose); cf. caukṣam
āsanaṃ prajñāpayitavyam 6; so Nobel, but most mss.
sa- rather than saṃ-; perh. read sa-caukṣaṃ, {%having%}
{%purity%}, i.e. {%pure?%} Or as s.v. {@sa-@}; caukṣa is recorded only
as adj., not noun. Tib. śin tu gtsaṅ ma, {%very pure%}.
