{@kalatra@}¦ (nt.; in Skt. only {%wife%} except once in Harṣac.
acc. to Thomas, {%retinue%}, see Schmidt, Nachtr.; see {@kaḍatra@}),
({@1@}) {%family%} (in the usual Eng. sense): Bbh 362.7 (bodhi-
sattvena sarvaḥ sattvadhātuḥ) kalatrabhāvena parigṛhī-
taḥ, {%cherished like%} or {%adopted as%} (one's own) {%family%} (oftener
{@kaḍatra@}, q.v.); ({@2@}) {%servants%} (familia), esp. perhaps {%male%}
{%servants%}: LV 139.12 (vs) dāsī-kalatra-jani (loc.) yādṛśam
ātmaprema (in a description of the qualities of a wife,
so that kalatra cannot possibly mean {%wife%}); Foucaux,
because of preceding dāsī, understands kalatra as referring
to males alone, which is possible but hardly necessary.
