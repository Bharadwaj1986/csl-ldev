{@kṣampana@}¦, nt., Mvy 8965, some article of a monk's
equipment; acc. to Tib. ḥur rdo, lit. {%noise-stone%}, but as
a cpd. {%sling%} (for throwing stones; so also Jap. and one
Chin. rendering, the other {%cannon%}, perh. orig. {%catapult?%}).
But what would a monk use a {%sling%} for? In a wholly
different direction leads AMg. khampaṇaya, {%winding-%}
{%sheet%} (Ratnach.); if our word is related to this it might
mean {%sheet%} or {%large piece of cloth%} of some kind. Uncertain.
