{@sostika@}¦ (nt., = Skt. svastika, cf. Pkt. satthia; in
other mgs., Pali sotthika; § 3.117), {%the cross-legged posture%}
{%in sitting%}: niṣaṇṇa °kena LV 241.12 (vs). Despite variants
in mss., this is the only true reading, and is supported
by Tib. (skyil mo kruṅ), contrary to Foucaux's statement
(Notes p. 156; there is in Tib.'s rendering of this line no
equivalent of narendraḥ, which is read in Calc. and some
mss.).
