<L>16359<pc>581,2<k1>संमोदते<k2>संमोदते, °दयति
{@saṃmodate, °dayati@}¦ (= Pali saṃmodati), {%carries on%}
{%a salutatory%} or {%greeting conversation with%}; it involves
inquiry into the health and well-being of the other person,
cf. Pali MN comm. i.110.5 ff.: rarely with acc. of person,
na tāḥ saṃmodayej jātu kauśalyaṃ sādhu pṛcchitum SP
280.1 (vs), {%he should not engage at all in conversation with%}
[Page582-a+ 71]
{%them to ask kindly after their welfare%}; usually with instr.
plus sārdhaṃ, devaiḥ sārdhaṃ ālapāmi saṃlapāmi saṃ-
mode (1 sg. pres. mid.) Bhīk 26b.3, cf. in 4 devā api mayā
sārdhaṃ ālapanti saṃlapanti pratisaṃmodante (see this;
here prati clearly = {%in return%}, as in Pali, e.g. Miln. 25.4);
the implication seems to be that despite the instr. with
sārdhaṃ which regularly precedes, the verb saṃmodate,
°dayati does not in itself involve {%mutual%} greetings, but
only those of the subject to another person; also with
cognate acc. (after instr. plus sārdhaṃ, or rarely saha)
saṃmodanīyāṃ kathāṃ saṃmodayitvā, {%having carried on%}
(such) {%a salutatory conversation%}, Mv iii.47.17; 60.11; 206.1;
208.12; 325.13; 394.13; 443.18, always followed by sārā-
yaṇīyāṃ kathāṃ vyatisārayitvā (or the like), see these
words. In similar phrases kṛtvā, or another ger., may be
substituted for saṃmodayitvā, see s.v. {@saṃmodana@}.
