{@? pelavaka@}¦, m. (mss. pelacaka, palavaka), in Mv
ii.161.2, see passage quoted s.v. {@anuśrotaṃ@}. Senart as-
sumes P. as proper name of a horse; it might as well be
a common noun, {%horse%} (cf. pelin, {%horse%} acc. to Wilson);
but the whole passage, esp. this word, is doubtful and
likely to be corrupt.
