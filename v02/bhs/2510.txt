{@ākāṅkṣati, °te@}¦ (cf. {@kāṅkṣati, kāṅkṣā@}; in Skt. only
{%desires%}, and so app. Pali ākaṅkhati), {%doubts%}: Mv i.165.3
ākāṅkṣamāṇā…vipaṇḍitā sattvā na jānanti…sukhaṃ
samādhiṃ, {%creatures that are doubting and ignorant do not%}
{%know bliss or concentration%}; perhaps Laṅk 14.19 (pracalita-
maulin) yad-yad evākāṅkṣasi ahaṃ te tasya-tasyaiva
praśnasya vyākaraṇena, (O chief of confused ones,) {%what-%}
{%ever you are doubtful about, by explaining every such question%}
{%to you I%} (etc.) (otherwise Suzuki); Sukh 99.6 is interpreted
by the ed. as mākāṅkṣayatha (i.e. mā āk°) mama ca
teṣāṃ ca buddhānāṃ…{%and have no doubt both of me and of%}
{%these Buddhas%}; but it could as well be mā kāṅkṣayatha
(= kāṅkṣatha). (Also {%desires%} as in Skt., e.g. Mv i.158.14.)
