{@gotra@}¦, m. and nt. (in Skt. only nt., and not in these
mgs.; Pali Dictt. also fail to record these mgs. except in
cpd. {@gotrabhū@}, q.v.; but Pali gotta seems clearly used in
mg. 1, below, in Vism. i.138.4--5, in definition of gotrabhū:
tam parittagottābhibhavanato mahaggatagottabhāvanato
ca gotrabhū ti pi vuccati; note how Pali here associates
the Sktized gotra-bhū with the MIndic gotta! contrast
Lévi's note on Sūtrāl. iii.1), ({@1@}) lit. {%family%}, but in special
technical sense of {%religious group%} or {%communion%}: pañca-
gotrāḥ Mvy 1260, listed 1261--5 śrāvaka-yānābhisamaya-
gotraḥ, pratyekabuddha-yānā°, tathāgata-yānā°, aniyata-
gotraḥ, a-gotraḥ; same five, with -gotraṃ, nt., Laṅk
63.2--5 (pañcābhisamaya-gotrāṇi); for the fourth, aniya-
taikatara-gotram, 63.4; in the sequel Laṅk explains at
length the first three; aniyata-, {%le gotra qui n'est pas%}
{%définitif%}, Lévi, Sūtrāl. iii.{@1@}, note, is briefly treated in Laṅk
65.2 f., aniyata-gotrakaḥ punar…triṣv apy eteṣu deśya-
māneṣu yatrānunīyate tatrānuyojyaḥ syāt; apparently
this is the class of people who may be drawn to whichever
of the three yānas happens to be presented. The a-gotra
is not explained but evidently means people outside of
any Buddhist communion; in this sense understand
gotrāgotraṃ kathaṃ Laṅk 25.2, (religious) {%family and%}
{%lack of it%} (dvandva cpd.). Only the first three gotras are
listed AbhidhK. LaV-P. vi.175; similarly Bbh 223.5--6
contrasts śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha-gotrāṃ (acc. pl.) with
tathāgata-gotrān. In KP 102.9; 103.1, 8 āryāṇāṃ gotraṃ
is described as a state in which all normal conditions and
activities are at an end, and in 104.1--2 (continuation of
the same) it is said, anulomaṃ tad gotraṃ nirvāṇasya.
The relation of this to the three or five gotras is not quite
clear. In the question, kena pravartitā gotrāḥ suvarṇa-
maṇimuktajāḥ Laṅk 26.3, gotra is prob. used in this same
sense, but the adj., {%sprung from gold, gems, and pearls%},
is obscure in application; one is tempted to see an allusion
(metaphorically) to the next mg., cf. especially suvarṇa-
gotra-vat Sūtrāl. iii.9 and suratna-gotra-vat 10, with
Lévi's note; but {%producing gold%} etc., which one would
expect, seems philologically impossible; ({@2@}) {%mine%}, of gems
or ores: Sūtrāl. iii.9, 10, above; sarvaratnasaṃbhavotpatti-
gotrākaramūlyajñāneṣu Gv 451.2; dhātu-gotrāṇi, {%mines%}

development of prec., {%kind, class, category%} (like Skt. jāti, of
similar origin and lit. mg.): nānāratna-gotra-puṣpaprati-
