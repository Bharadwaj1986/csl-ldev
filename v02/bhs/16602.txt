{@sahita@}¦, adj. ({@1@}) (= Pali id.) of speech, {%connected,%}
{%coherent, sensible%}: Mvy 474 (°tā, of Buddha's speech);
sahitaṃ ca bhūtaṃ ({%true%}) ca sadā prabhāṣate SP 373.4;
sahitaṃ…sumadhuraṃ…abravīt Mv i.145.7 = 201.7
= ii.5.2 (Senart i.490 wrongly {%kindly, agreeable%}); MSV
ii.174.2 (read) tavāsahitam, mama sahitam; ({@2@}) of hair
and eyebrows, in sahita-bhrū LV 107.8 and sahita-keśa
12, both in list of {@anuvyañjana@} of the Buddha (Senart
also reads sahita-keśa in Mv ii.44.10, but read with mss.
{@ahasita-keśa@}, q.v.); Tib. LV both times mñam pa =
{%even%}, which usually renders Skt. sama and has both mgs.,
{%alike%}, and {%level, flat, smooth%}; prob. therefore {%with smooth%}
(orig. {%connected%}, so {%close-growing%}; perhaps {%thick?%}) {%eyebrows%}
and {%hair%}. These terms seem to be substitutions for, and
roughly equivalent to, ślakṣṇa-bhrū and -keśa of other
texts (Nos. 65 and 76 of my list of anuvyañjana), both
of which are lacking in LV. In Pali, Therīg. 254, sahita
is used of a young woman's hair compared to a grove:
kānanaṃ va sahitaṃ (comm. 210.7 ghanasaṃnivesaṃ
uddham eva uṭṭhita-uddhadīghasākhaṃ upavanaṃ viya;
in accordance with this Mrs. Rhys Davids renders
{%dense%}).
