{@āsarita@}¦, nt., and {@niḥsarita@}, nt.; °taṃ Gv 351.18, 19
respectively: the first two of ten ‘bodily conditions’
(śarīrasthā dharmāḥ), the other 8 being cold, heat, hunger,
thirst, delight, anger, birth-old-age-diesase-and-death, and
pain (pīḍā). Context throws no further light. Interpre-
tation of these two terms obscure. Are they somehow
related to āsario = saṃmukhāgataḥ Deśīn. 1.69, and
ṇissariaṃ = srastam ibid. 4.40? Something like {%slack%}
{%condition, slumped-down state%} might be intended by
niḥsarita; would āsarita be its opposite, a state {%arrived%}
at the right point?
