{@katara@}¦, pron. adj. (see also {@katira@}; cf. {@anyatara@};
used in this way sometimes in Pali and apparently even
in Skt., where however the cases are rare and not always
certain), {%which%} (of more than two)?: Divy 102.17; 308.8;
371.23 kataraḥ (of several) kumāro…rājā bhaviṣyati;
Śikṣ 75.4; KP 97.4 kataraṃ (cited Śikṣ 233.15 as katarat)
cittaṃ; MSV iii.136.10 (read kataraṃ tat), 12. In LV
239.15 (Ārāḍasya dharmo…) na niryāti tat-katarasya
samyagduḥkhakṣayāya, and Mv ii.119.5 (nāyaṃ) Ārāḍasya
dharmo niryāti tat-katarasya (so mss.) samyagduḥkha-
kṣayāye, could at best (but implausibly) be taken to mean
{%A.'s religion does not result in the complete destruction of%}
{%the misery of anyone%}. But Senart emended to tat-karasya,
{%of (for) the one who performs it%} (sc. Ā.'s religion), which
is confirmed by Tib. on LV de byed pa, {%one who has done%}
{%that%}. It is indeed strange to find the same corruption in
both texts; but the em. seems quite certain; it is con-
firmed by Pali takkarassa DN i.235.17; MN i.68.12, in
a quite similar phrase; and in a close parallel Mv ii.120.16
one ms. reads tatkarasya (the other corruptly taktenasya).
