{@chavi@}¦ (= Skt., Pali id., {%skin%}), {%bark%} (of a tree): kovi-
dārasya chavigandhaḥ Gv 501.11 (prose). Acc. to the
English of Ratnach., chavi may have this mg. in AMg.;
this is a translation of Hindi chāl, which seems to mean
both {%skin%} and {%bark%}; whether the AMg. word also means
{%bark%} I do not know.
