{@pāṃśulika@}¦, nt., or {@°kā@} (= AMg. paṃsuliyā; cf. Pali
phāsulī, °likā; the aspiration in Pali ph- is unhistorical),
{%rib%}: °likāni °likāntarāṇi Mv ii.125.15; 127.2; 128.8; 129.10;
to be read thus, or else pāṃśulikāntarāṇi (omitting °likāni),
{%(ribs and) interstices between the ribs%}; so the mss. clearly
indicate tho with various corruptions; confirmed by AMg.;
Senart em. pārśuli°. The form is of course related to Skt.
parśu(kā), BHS {@pārśukā@}, q.v., and is hyper-Sktized from
the MIndic represented by AMg., which has nasalized
vowel for double consonant (or long vowel), by the ‘law
of morae’.
