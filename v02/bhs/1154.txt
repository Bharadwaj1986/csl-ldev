{@antareṇa@}¦, instr. of n. used as adv. and prep. (in
this sense nowhere recorded in Skt. or MIndic), {%(at a)%}
{%later time%} (orig. {%interval%}): yena antareṇa ahaṃ prasūtā
bhaviṣyaṃ tato gamiṣyaṃ Mv i.365.3, {%at what later time,%}
{%after what interval, when%} (later)…; adv., {%afterwards, after%}
(this) Mv ii.362.8 (with no dependent noun; Senart wrongly
{%in the interval%}); atrāntareṇa {%after this%} Mv i.96.6 (so mss.,
to be kept, Senart em. wrongly); mamāntareṇa {%after me%}
SP 26.4 (vs); LV 39.4 (prose); yo (e)tasya (mss.) mṛgīye
antareṇa Mv i.362.5, 7, {%who%} (comes) {%after this doe%} (here
Senart correctly recognizes the mg., referring to Burnouf
on SP 26.4, where the right interpretation is already
given). (In Mv ii.209.6 mamāntareṇa means {%with reference%}
{%to me%}; Senart misunderstands. Skt. uses antareṇa in this
sense with acc. and also with gen., see BR 5.997.)
