{@Bhadrajit@}¦, n. of a disciple of Buddha: Sukh 2.3; in
form the name = Pali Bhaddaji, but actually it is evident
that it is a substitute for {@Bhadrika@} (2), since it follows
the names of the four other {@bhadravargīya@}; perh. it
was altered under the influence of {@Aśvajit@}, the second of
this list.
