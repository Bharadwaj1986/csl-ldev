{@āśītakī@}¦, or {@ās°@}, also written aśītaka, aśīta, aśitaka,
asita, the a-stems being prob. m. (Mv ii.231.13); the Pali
equivalent is āsītika, m. (not °kā, f., as stated in PTSD),
n. of some plant; occurs, regularly in comp. with -parvāṇi
(as in Pali with -pabbāni, MN i.80.11 = 245.27), in the
account of the Bodhisattva's emaciated state after his
long fast, his members being compared to the joints of
this plant. The reading asita(ka) is prob. due to popular
etymology, association with asita {%black%}; {@kāla@}, q.v., occurs
in the context, and note kālāśītako (perhaps read °ke
with v.l.) Mv ii.231.13. Other cases, all in comp. with
parvāṇi: LV 254.7 āsītakī-; 255.21 āśītakī- (all mss.;
Lefm. inexplicably reads āsitakī- here!); Mv ii.126.18
aśītaka- (v.l. asita-); in 125.12 Senart omits the word
with one ms., but the other ms. has aśita-parvāṇi; 128.5
aśitaka- (one ms., the other omits, Senart em. aśītaka-);
129.7 aśīta- (v.l. asita-). The evidence points, on the whole,
to āśītaka- or °kī- as the original form.
