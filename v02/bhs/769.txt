1 {@anu@}¦, indecl. in noun and verb cpds.; (a) in distrib-
utive (? or intensive) noun cpds., as in Pali, CPD s.v.
anu (g); also in JM, e.g. gāmāṇugāmaṃ Jacobi Erz. 13.2;
rare in Skt., ‘typical in Buddh.’, Renou, Gr. scte. p. 94:
divasānudivasaṃ, adv., {%day after day%}, Av i.208.10; 261.14;
see {@kālānukālam, kṣudrānukṣudra, kṣudrakānukṣu-@}
{@draka, anucāra, anudharma@}; but the usage is not al-
ways clear and the last-named, at least, prob. does not
belong here; (b) in verb cpds. used in many cases which
have no parallels in Skt., nor (often) even in Pali or Pkt.;
usually before other preverbs. See the following entries
in this work. Very often it is hard to see any definite
meaning which anu adds; Tib. in its wooden way renders
by rjes su, {%after%}, which as Jäschke says ‘is often not to
be translated’.
