{@sāhasrī@}¦ (= AMg. sāhassī; cf. {@sahasrī@}), {%(a group of)%}
{%one thousand%}: in Mv i.148.17 (vs) five of six mss. read
viṃśa sahasriyo teṣāṃ, but meter seems to favor, with
Senart, viṃśat sāh°. In some citations under {@sahasrī@},
in prose, some mss. read sāh°. Cf. {@tri-sāhasrī@}, but this
seems to be adjectival (sc. lokadhātu).
