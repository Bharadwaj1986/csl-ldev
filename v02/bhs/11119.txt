{@? bhaḍḍalikā@}¦, perh. n. of some animal: Pischel SBBA
1904 p. 817, fol. 169 b; Pischel p. 824 suggests dubiously
connexion with (ambaka)maddarī of the corresp. Pali
passage AN i.188.2. He is probably right, but unfortunately
this doesn't help much; the Pali word is very obscure;
acc. to the comm. ii.304.14 the cpd. means {%a young hen%}
(khuddaka-kukkuṭikā).
