{@tvagbhāra@}¦ (m.), part of a tree, some part of the bark
or a kind of bark: °ra-taś ca Divy 628.1, see s.v. {@phalgu 1@}.
One is tempted to em. to tvaksāra- (Pali tacasāra); the
fact that sārataḥ follows is no objection, since it means
{%as to the pith%}; but unless the mss. actually read tvak-,
the misreading implied is not easy to assume.
