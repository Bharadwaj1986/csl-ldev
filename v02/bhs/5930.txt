{@grahaṇa@}¦, nt., confused with {@gahana@}, {%thicket, entan-%}
{%glement%} (?): in Mv i.34.7 (prose) -durga-saṃsāra-kāntāra-
grahaṇa-dāruṇāto mahā-prapātāto uddharitvā, Senart
thinks that grahaṇa is a copyist's hyper-Skt. alteration
of gahana, which is a near-synonym of kāntāra (esp. in
Pali, where diṭṭhi-kantāra and diṭṭhi-gahana are often
closely associated); in spite of this, I think grahaṇa may
be sound and orig.: {%rescuing from a great abyss that is%}
{%dreadful because of the grip of the forest of the saṃsāra etc%}.
In Mv i.91.14--17 occur four lines of verse in which the
mss. repeatedly vary between gahana and grahaṇa; the
text is both very corrupt and fragmentary; Senart's note
is a very earnest effort to disentangle it, but I find it
hardly convincing, tho I am inclined to agree that puns
are here contained, involving gahana, {%entanglement,%}
{%obstruction, difficulty%}, as well as {%thicket%}, and grahaṇa,
{%seizure, imprisonment%} (perhaps also {%eclipse%}, as by Rāhu,
so Skt.); the text, with the most important vv.ll., reads:
14 vanagahanaṃ (mss. °grahanaṃ or °ṇaṃ) balagahanaṃ
(3 mss. °grah°) girigahanāni (em.; 5 mss. °gahanaṃ, one
°grahaṇaṃ) tyāgagrahaṇāni (3 mss. °gahanāni), 15 viṣa-
māprati- (mss. viṣamapati-)-saṃniṣaṇṇavanāni tu manu-
ṣyagahanāni (5 mss. °graha°), 16 tṛṇagulmakaṇṭakalatā-
kulāni vṛkṣagrahaṇā- (mss. °grahaṇya- or °nya-) gahanāni
(3 mss. grahaṇāni), 17 śaṭhanikṛtipaiśunyāni tu manuṣya-
gahanāni (5 mss. °grahanāni or °ṇāni). Tho Senart's
interpretation seems very dubious, I cannot suggest with
confidence any improvements. The meter is meant for
āryā. See also {@gahana, gahana-tā@}.
