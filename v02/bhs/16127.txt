{@samudita@}¦, in ālaya-samudita Mv iii.314.3, 4, see
s.v. {@ālaya@} (2): {%taking delight in%} is certainly the mg. It
is natural to think of em. to saṃmudita; but the corresp.
Pali has in SN i.136.12 and 13 samudita, and this is a
v.l. for saṃmudita of text in another parallel Vin. i.4.36 f.
On the other hand, we find in Pali similar triple formulas
containing -ārāma, -rata, and -saṃmudita in MN i.503.22;
SN iv.389.10; 390.1--2. PTSD recognizes samudita, {%excited%}
(allegedly from sam-ud-i, {%‘aroused’%}), as well as saṃmudita
{%delighted%}, and Childers cites, without reference, samudi-
tamano ({%elevated, excited%}) udaggamano attamano, where
the meaning seems clearly {%rejoiced%}. I have failed to note
saṃmudita in BHS, or any other occurrence of samudita
in this sense. Surely one of the two words is an ancient
corruption of the other.
