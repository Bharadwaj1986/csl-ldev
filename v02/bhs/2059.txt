{@avacaraka (1)@}¦ m. (= Pali id.), {%messenger%}, (secret)
{%agent%}: Mvy 3807 = Tib. bya ma rta, {%courier%} (v.l. apa°, but
Mironov ava° without v.l.); Divy 32.25; 127.26; 287.3;
({@2@}) (m.?) in Gv 522.1 tac ca gṛhaṃ vā avacarakaṃ vā
vipulaṃ paśyet, {%and he would see%} (in his dream) {%that house%}
{%or locality%} (? the preceding sentence is our only clue to the
mg. and it is so general that it gives little help) {%as vast%}.
Is it a ka-derivative of avacara (physical) {%domain?%} Or an
otherwise unrecorded word for some kind of building?
Ratnach. records AMg. ocāra (= avacāra), {%a granary or%}
{%store-house of grain%}, which does not fit our context.
