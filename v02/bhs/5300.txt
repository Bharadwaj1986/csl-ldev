{@kriyā@}¦ (not in this sense in Skt., nor so far as I have
found in Pali; the definition {%promise, vow%}, given PTSD
s.v. kiriyā 1(b), is not supported by a careful study of the
few passages cited), {%decision, determination%}: Mv i.310.6
(cf. line 8 and Senart's note p. 602) eṣa brāhmaṇapariṣāya
kriyā anuparivartitavyā, {%this decision of the brahman-%}
{%assembly must be followed%} (observed, concurred in); SP
186.6--7 etāṃ kriyāṃ śroṣyanti, {%they will hear this decision%}
(determination, viz. what is then stated, that there is only
one nirvāṇa). Cf. {@kriyākāra, kriyābandha@}, in which
kriyā- seems to have this same mg.; neither of them has
been recorded elsewhere. In MSV ii.109.8, 16, kriyāhṛta
(kriyā-āhṛta), with lābha, kriyā is short for {@kriyākāra@},
{%agreement%}; note kriyākāraṃ kṛtvā, 17.
