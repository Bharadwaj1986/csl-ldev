[{@ura(s)@}¦, {%womb?%} So acc. to Senart on Mv i.199.10 =
ii.3.8 (vs), ed. divasāni sapta māsā ca daśa tasyā uram
otaret. The meter is bad even so; mss. in i.199.10 read
udare-m-, which suggests a form of udara, the word we
should expect; I find no record of ura(s) in the required
mg. Perhaps the orig. had something like…daśa tasyodar’
(for tasyā udaram or udare) otaret.]
