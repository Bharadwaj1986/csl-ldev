{@kāṇḍarika@}¦, m. (v.l. kaṇḍ°, but no v.l. in Mironov),
[Page176-b+ 71]
Mvy 8783, defined by Tib. smad ḥchal, which is reported
to mean {%prostitution, dissoluteness%} (and Jap. {%one who%}
{%frequents prostitutes%}); MSV iv.68.11. But Chin. {%one who%}
{%is defective in the lower parts%}; and the surrounding terms in
Mvy and MSV (khañja, khela, kāṇa, etc.) are all adjectives
referring to physical deformities, thus supporting the Chin.
The Tib. word smad means {%lower%}, and may be used of the
lower limbs; ḥchol (ḥchal) ba may mean {%to be confused,%}
{%deranged%}.
