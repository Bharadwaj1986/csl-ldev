{@uttari@}¦ (apparently the usual form; also {@uttarī@}, chiefly
if not wholly m.c.; {@uttariṃ@}, once {@uttarīṃ; uttare,@}
{@°reṇa@}; possibly {@uttaraṃ@}, but use of this as separate adv.
uncertain; in prior part of cpds. uttari-, °re-, °raṃ-,
besides normal Skt. uttara-; Pali apparently only uttariṃ
as separate word, uttari- in prior part of cpds, besides
uttara-) adv., and prep. or postposition with abl. or gen.,
{%further, beyond%}, of time, space, number, etc.; synonym of
bhūyas; all the forms enumerated seem to be equivalent
and interchangeable to the extent indicated above; none
seem recorded in these uses in Skt. or Pkt. acc. to the
dictionaries; once uttarī may be intended as n. sg. m. of
an adj., Bbh 102.15 (prose) na ebhya uttarī na ebhyo

{%these, greater than these%} (cf. the next passages); with de-
pendent abl., usually atas, tatas: nāsty ata uttari nāsty
ato bhūyaḥ (cf. prec.) Bbh 25.17 (prose); nāta uttari
nāto bhūyaḥ 36.18; (cf., without dependent, kutaḥ punar
uttari kuto bhūyaḥ 297.22;) tatottarī (m.c.?) agaṇiyu

isolated) bahukalpaṃ Dbh.g. 17(353).17, {%many kalpas%}

to LV corresponds Mv ii.119.5 and 120.16 where uttari
has no dependent form); ato ca uttari Mv iii.55.15 (prose);

Mv i.2.2, Senart em., but read with mss. {@pratyot°@}, q.v.;

meter), prob. read °karasyottareṇa, which may mean

equals); Mv iii.396.9 (prose; parallel to Pali Sn prose after

4.3 (vs); Śikṣ 16.14 (prose); Dbh.g. 20(356).17; 23(359).2;
in some of the preceding uttari occurs in situations where
we should except an adjective, which seems even more
called for in the next, where, however, f. or m. gender
would be demanded: (na sā strī…saṃvidyate) yā tasyā
rūpeṇa samā kutaḥ punar uttari Gv 172.21 (prose)…{%no%}
{%one who would be equal to her in beauty, how much less%}
{%beyond%} (superior to) {%her!%}, and parallels in the sequel with
masc. for fem., but always uttari, 172.23, 26, etc.; uttarī
(prob. m.c., but cf. Bbh 102.15 above), na uttarī prārthayi
(ger., or aor.?) SP 213.10, {%not asking%} (or, {%we did not ask%})
{%further%}; uttariṃ (not m.c., tho in vss!), Dbh.g. 6(342).9;
te kalpakoṭīm athavāpi cottariṃ…Sukh 45.6; uttare,
sometimes, as in the first two, interpretable as n. sg. m.
of uttara (§ 8.25), but so closely parallel in use to uttari
that it is better taken as adv.: jātyā ca so viṃśatir uttare
vā SP 313.8 (vs); sadṛśo 'sti na te kutottare LV 364.18
(Lefm. with mss. kutontare, Foucaux cites kutottare
from a ms., and this is certainly meant); na me 'sty ato
'rtha(ḥ), ata uttare gaṇana apratimasya jñānam (so read)
LV 151.4--5 (vs); kaścid uttare naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā-
yatanasamāpatter mārgaḥ LV 245.3 (prose); uttare vai
nānāmiṣeṇa saṃtarpya Gv 146.3, similarly 146.16; 152.15
(all prose); te kalpakoṭīr athavāpi uttare Sukh 74.17
(cf. 45.6, above; vs but end of pāda), {%they, for crores of%}
{%kalpas or even further…%}; in LV 119.6 (vs) reading un-
certain, kuta uttaraṃ (so Lefm. with ms. A, other mss.
°ri, unmetr.; Calc. {@°rī@}, perhaps rightly) vā, {%how could%}
{%there be one higher%} (prob. adverb); [in Mv ii.243.7 (prose)
ed. tasya pañjarasya uttariṃ sthitvā, but read with v.l.
upari, {%on top of the cage%}; this mg. is not found for uttari(ṃ);]
in composition, uttari-jñāna-viśeṣasūcanatāyai Gv 191.11
(prose; apparently substantially = uttara); note esp.
[Page124-a+ 71]
uttarottari-(v.l. °ra-)-viśiṣṭatara-kuśalamūla- LV 429.14
(prose), {%more and more exceedingly superior roots of merit%};
(ekam pudgalaṃ sthāpayitvā) śaikṣapratipady uttari-
karanīyaṃ Sukh 2.13 (prose), (except one person) {%who%}
{%had something left to do in the śaikṣa course%} (the rest all
being arhats); note that Pali has the same cpd. uttari-
karaṇīya, but acc. to PTSD only as a karmadharaya,
{%an additional duty%}, not as a bahuvrīhi as here; in some of
the above it is not certain whether uttari- is compounded
with the following word or a separate adverb; in LV
246.16; 263.11, above, uttari must be prep., governing
manuṣyadharmād; to these passages correspond Mv
ii.121.7, 12; 122.2 uttari-manuṣyadharmasya jñānāye
darśanāye saṃbodhāye; Senart takes the word as a cpd.,
depending on jñānāye etc., prob. rightly, tho the gen.
manuṣyadharmasya might be dependent on prep. uttari;
the latter construction is impossible, and a cpd. (= Pali
uttarimanussadhamma, {%superhuman faculties%} or {%conditions%};
the analysis of the Pali comm. cited by Childers is incon-
sistent with that indicated by LV 246.16 and 263.11)
must be assumed in Mv ii.130.12 kaṃcid uttarimanuṣya-
dharmaṃ; Divy 145.21, 28 and 146.16 uttarimanuṣya-
dharme (so with mss., ed. wrongly em. uttare man°);
Śikṣ 62.4 uttarimanuṣyadharmair; besides this, the same
cpd. is recorded in BHS (not in Pali) as uttara-manuṣya-
dharma-(-pralāpa, m.), Mvy 8367, {%declaring%} (falsely the
possession of) {%superhuman faculties%} (one of the {@parajika@}
sins); also uttaraṃ-man° Divy 144.4, 28; 145.18 (mss.,
in 144.4 ed. em. °re); Bhīk 26a.3; uttare-man° Divy 144.9,
13, 21, 23, 27; 145.3, 11, 13, 17; 146.8, 25 (in all these
read as cpd.; ed. takes uttare as separate adj., misled by
the fact that the cpd. is a loc., ending °dharme; see above
for evidence that uttare = uttari as adv. and prep.); in
Divy 144.5 apparently anuttare is used as synonym of
uttare in this cpd. (taken by ed. as separate adj.), yady
ekaṃ śramaṇo Gautamo 'nuttare-manuṣyadharme riddhi-
prātihāryaṃ vidarśayiṣyati vayaṃ dve (see {@anuttara@};
but this word does not fit and must be either a cor-
ruption, or a sign of misunderstanding by the author of
the passage; elsewhere in the same passage only forms
of uttara-, uttari- etc. are used).
