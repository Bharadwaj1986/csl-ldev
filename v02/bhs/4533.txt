{@karpāsa-picu@}¦ (m.; = Pali kappāsa-picu; cpd. not
noted in Skt., where picu is masc.), {%cotton%} (in some form),
used as symbol of lightness: Divy 210.15; 388.15, along
with {@tūlapicu@}, q.v.; both together in Pali in the same
way SN v.284.1; there evidently was some difference
between the two, but what?
