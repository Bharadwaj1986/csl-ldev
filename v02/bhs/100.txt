{@agasti-harītakī@}¦, a kind of plant or tree: Mvy 5781;
Tib. a-gas (partial transliteration). In Mironov agasti and
harītakī are presented as separate items, perhaps cor-
rectly; {@agasti@} is recorded as n. of a plant or tree in Skt.
But the Kyōtō ed. interprets {@Agasti-@} in the cpd. as the
ṛṣi-name.
