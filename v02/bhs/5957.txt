{@Ghaṭikāra@}¦, MSV {@Ghaṭī°@} (= Pali Ghaṭīkāra), n. of
a potter who was a disciple of the Buddha Kāśyapa,
Mv i.319.9 ff.; 326.10 ff., and later became one of the
Śuddhāvāsa gods, in which capacity he with others of
that class of gods fashioned magically the Four Sights
for the Bodhisattva Śākyamuni to see, Mv ii.150.16;
152.10 ff.; MSV i.217.12 (called {@Nandīpāla@}). He lived at
{@Veruḍiṅga@} or {@Vebha°, Vaibhiḍiṅgī@}, the later {@Māra-@}
{@karaṇḍa@}, qq.v. Several parts of his legend (not, apparently,
his part in creating the Four Sights) recur in Pali, see DPPN.
