<L>9647<pc>349,2<k1>पुष्किरिणी<k2>पुष्किरिणी
{@puṣkiriṇī@}¦ (see also puṣkaraṇī and next two), a very
common spelling instead of Skt. puṣkariṇī, {%lotus-pool%}; not
noted elsewhere; editors often em., and mss. sometimes
vary; so for °karaṇī of text Mv i.227.18 there is a v.l.
°kiriṇī, while Senart prints °kiriṇī Mv iii.329.16, with v.l.
°kariṇī; in Divy mss. seem regularly to write °kiriṇī, so
114.10; 116.6 (in these two, but not later, ed. em. °kariṇī);
118.5 (here ed. em. °karaṇī); 165.9; 194.2; 221.6 ff.; 244.20;
248.23, 25, etc.; in Av regularly °kiriṇī, acc. to Speyer
on i.75.11, who does not em.; in RP likewise in ms., but
Finot em. °kariṇī, 40.14 ff.; 56.14; others, Kv 54.1; Gv
193.17; 519.2.
