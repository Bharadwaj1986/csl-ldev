{@sa-pratīśa@}¦ or {@°sa@}, adj. (see s.v. {@a-pratīśa@}; = Pali
sappaṭissa, °tissa), {%respectful%}: spelled with ś, Mvy 1776;
Mv iii.372.5; Divy 333.16, 26; Śikṣ 189.10; KP 10.6;
°śa-tā, {%state of being…%}, Bhīk 31b.5; with s, Mv i.174.3;
ii.287.6; LV 102.21, text su-pra°, read with v.l. sa-pra°;
Divy 484.15, 20 (mss. s, ed. em. ś); Mmk 491.15; mss.
vary, ś or s, Mv ii.258.9; iii.345.18; Divy 484.25; in Mv
ii.200.19 Senart by em. sapatissa-, but with not even
remote or partial support in mss., and resulting in incor-
rect meter; in LV 160.10 Lefm. sa-pratīkṣāḥ (which would
accord with Senart's conjecture as to the etymology, see
s.v. apratīśa), but no ms. supports the reading; they point
rather to sapratīśāḥ, tho most are confused. Usually
preceded by sa-gaurava ({@°gārava@}).
