{@okkarika@}¦, m. (= {@aukarika@}, q.v.; acc. to Feer,
Transl. of Av, = Tib. yul tsoṅ [read tshoṅ] pa, see below),
some kind of tradesman; Feer, ‘country merchant’; but
yul, which indeed often means janapada (opp. to {%town%}),
in comp. with tshoṅ pa, {%merchant%}, could possibly mean
{%dealer in agricultural products%}, something like {%truck-farmer%};
possibly cf. ogara, oggara, cited by Sheth from Prākṛta-
piṅgala as meaning {%a king of grain%} or {%rice%}. Certainly not
a keeper of a shop in the country, for the story shows that
it means a member of an urban tradesman's guild, parallel
with perfumers: Av i.198.7 pitā te okkarika āsīd; 10
[Page158-1b+ 43]
tenaukkarikāpaṇo vyavasthāpitaḥ; 12 tenaukkarika-tvaṃ
tyaktvā. The story is the same as that in which Divy uses
{@aukarika@}. I see no reason to associate with either of these
words the n. pr. {@Utkarika@} or {@Otk°@}, qq.v.
