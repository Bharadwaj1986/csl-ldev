{@tuṇa@}¦ (m. or nt.; cf. {@tūṇa, tuṇava@}; AMg. tuṇā [tuṇa?],
an unidentified mus. instrument), some musical instru-
ment: in lists, tuṇa-paṇava-mṛdaṅgāṃ LV 80.5; tuṇa-
veṇu-(text vaiṇu-)-ravaiḥ 173.9; tuṇa-vīṇā-sughoṣakādi-
bhiḥ 177.14. Tib. confused; it may intend this word by
rgyud gcig (pa) in the first two (see under {@tuṇava@}), but
if so the order varies from our text; on 177.14 this Tib.
word does not occur, and tuṇa may be gliṅ bu (otherwise
= veṇu or vaṃśa), altho the order suggests sgra sñan,
but this elsewhere = sughoṣaka. In spite of Tib., which
suggests a stringed (or in 177.14 a wind?) instrument,
perhaps really a kind of {%drum%}.
