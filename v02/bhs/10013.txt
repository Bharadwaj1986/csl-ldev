{@pratipad@}¦, f., also {@°dā@} (= Pali paṭipadā), {%course of%}
{%conduct, practice, behavior%}, esp. {%good, approved behavior%},
= {@pratipatti@}, q.v.; acc. to Childers and PTSD, so also
primarily Pali paṭipadā; this mg. is recognized by Speyer
on Av ii.130.2, which he reads by em. araṇya-°daṃ
samādāya (better, I think araṇāṃ pra°, see s.v. {@araṇya@};
in that case render {%passionless way of behavior%}); he also
accepts this mg. in puṇyāṃ pratipadam udbhāvayan
dānadamasaṃyamādibhiḥ Jm 100.10, {%displaying meritorious%}
{%behavior by…%}; vākpragraheṇa pratipanmayena Jm 105.2,
{%by%} (the kind of) {%acceptance of his words which consists of%}
{%behavior%}, i.e. by not only assenting verbally but putting
them into practice; (anayāpi…caryayānayāpi) pratipadā
LV 263.11 (pratipad = caryā), and similarly 264.18;
often rendered {%way, path%}, and called ‘a quasi-synonym
of magga’ in PTSD; this is due to the fact that the {%middle%}
{%course of conduct%}, madhyamā pratipad(ā), is (in BHS as
in Pali) identified with the eight-fold way (mārga) stated
in the fourth Noble Truth, but the terms are quite differ-
ently defined, ma° pra° being the course of {%behavior%} which
steers between the two extremes (anta) of violent asceticism
and worldliness; the lack of real synonymity between Pali
magga and paṭipadā is shown, e.g., by DN ii.154.25-26
(kaṅkhā vā vimati vā) Buddhe vā dhamme vā saṃghe vā
magge vā paṭipadāya vā (obviously different things must
be meant); madhyamayaiva pratipadā LV 416.21 (con-
trasted with amadhyamā pratipad = violent asceticism,
416.19); here as elsewhere such a statement introduces
the Four Noble Truths, the fourth of which is duḥkhaniro-
dhagāminī pratipad (with or without āryasatyam, in LV
417.3, 12 without it, in 12 = eṣa evāryāṣṭāṅgamārgaḥ);
so Mvy 1314, 1319, 1324; Mv ii.138.5 (with āryasatyam)
and 10 (without it); 285.4 (without it); SP 179.3 (with it);
more metaphysical interpretations of the term madhyamā
pratipad in Bbh 39.26; KP 52.6 and repeatedly in following
sections; one of the ten bala of a Tathāgata is sarvatragā-
manī-pratipaj-jñānam Mvy 125, cf. sarvatragāminī-(the
more usual form)-pratipatti-jñāna-balam Dharmas 76
(note obvious equivalence of pratipad and pratipatti!),
{%power of knowledge of courses of conduct which may lead to%}
{%any result%}; in same context sarvatragāminīṃ ca prati-
padaṃ (v.l. °dāṃ) vetti Mv i.159.13 (vs), and, for another,
see s.v. {@pratipadā@}; parānukampā-pratipad Jm 28.7,
{%conducting oneself with compassion for others%}; nairyāṇika-
(and °kī) pratipad, see s.v. {@nairyāṇika@}; śaikṣa-pratipady
uttarikaraṇīyam (see this) Sukh 2.13, {%in the course%} ({%practice%};
here we could also, no doubt, translate {%path%}) of the {@śaikṣa@}
(q.v.); there are four {%courses of conduct%} (Tib. lam, {%way,%}
{%path%}, but also {%manner of conduct%}) Mvy 1244--1248, viz
duḥkhā pra° dhandhābhijñā, sukhā pra° dhandhābhijñā,
duḥkhā pra° kṣiprābhijñā, sukhā pra° kṣiprā° (for the
corresponding Pali list, and interpretation, see Childers
s.v. paṭipadā). See also next.
