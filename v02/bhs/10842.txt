{@baddhamālā@}¦, {%having a garland bound on%}, n. of the
2d bodhisattva-bhūmi; so read for ed. °mānā Mv i.76.14.
It is inconceivable that such a name as the mss. present
should be applied to a bhūmi; and my em. is supported
in sense by puṣpamaṇḍitā, n. of the 3d bhūmi immediately
following. This word cannot, therefore, be cited (with
Renou, Etudes de gram. scte., 1936, p.18) as an example
of -māna added to a ppp. (§ 34.1).
