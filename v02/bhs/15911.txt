{@Samantaprabhāsa@}¦, reading of SP edd. in most
occurrences for n. of a future Buddha, which it is predicted
that Ājñāta Kauṇḍinya will become, SP 206.11, and
also n. of 500 future Buddhas which 500 ‘great disciples’
will become, 207.2. But the true reading in both places
is prob. {@Samantaprabha@} (1), with Kashgar rec. In the
same account, °prabha is read without v.l. in 207.9 and
208.10, guaranteed by meter; in 208.5 text reads prabhā-
sanāmasya (referring to the former case), but Kashgar
rec. Samantaprabha-; in 209.4 text Samantaprabhāsasya,
metr. very bad, Kashgar rec. and one Nep. ms. °prabhasya,
better metrically (°prābhasya is required).
