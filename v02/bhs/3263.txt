{@ucchada- (1)@}¦ (= Pali ussada; = {@ucchādana@}, q.v.),
{%shampooing, rubbing down%}: KP 152.2 ucchada-snapana-
parimardana-bhedana-vikiraṇa-vidhvaṃsana-dharmaḥ (of
the body); ({@2@}) in Śikṣ 208.11 -sāntarocchada-paṭikobhaya-
kṛtopadhāneṣu paryaṅkeṣu śayitvā; Bendall and Rouse
app. understand ucchada as some kind of {%cloth%} (cf. {@uccha-@}
{@daka@}); but the preceding sāntara, which certainly goes
closely with what follows it, is hard to interpret on that
theory, and suggests em. to {@sāntarottara@} (q.v.), a cpd.
known to Pali; it might mean here…{%having cushions%}
{%made on both sides with woolen cloths inside and outside%};
({@3@}) in Av i.354.10 Speyer's em. is certainly wrong. The
ms. is quoted as prāptaucchadakāyaś ca; certainly uc-
chada = {@utsada@} (1), Pali ussada, {%elevation%} on the 7 parts
of the body which show this feature in a mahāpuruṣa;
Tib. mtho ba confirms this. Acc. to Speyer, Tib. has
mdun, {%fore-part%}, before that word; but surely Tib. read,
or intended, bdun, {%seven%}, and we must read sapto- for
prāptau-; the cpd. means {%with a body possessing the 7%}
{%high places%} or {%protuberances%} (see under utsada (1), and cf.
Bbh 375.20 saptotsadakāyaḥ).--Add to ({@2@}): my sugge-
stion on Śikṣ 208.11 is made dubious by sottarocchada-
paṭa (ms.; ed. em. sottaracch°), adj., MPS 34.68 and 69.
