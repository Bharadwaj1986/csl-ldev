{@elapatra@}¦, m., ({@1@}) one of four ‘great treasures’ (ma-
hānidhi; cf. a similar group of four treasures in Pali,
DN comm. i.284.8, saṅkha, ela, uppala, puṇḍarīka), each
presided over by a nāga-king of (presumably) the same
name (so definitely stated for Elapatra): Mv iii.383.18--
384.1 catvāro mahānidhayo saṃkho vārāṇasyāṃ mithilā-
yāṃ (19) padumo kaliṃgeṣu piṃgalo takṣaśilāyāṃ ela-
patro; vārāṇasyāṃ saṃkhasya māsiko (20) samājo vartati;
tahiṃ nidhānādhipatayo nāgarājāno nimantritakā āgatā;
(384.1) tatra ca elapatreṇa nāgarājñā praśnā sthāpitā
(see below for Pali equivalent); ({@2@}) Elapatra, in Mv iii.384.1,
above, n. of a nāga-king presiding over the ‘treasure’ of
the same name; presumably the same as the nāga (or
nāga-king) named (without reference to the ‘treasure’)
Mvy 3271 (Kyoto ed. Elāpattra, by error; Mironov Ela°
with no v.l.); Suv 162.9; Mmk 452.20; Kv 2.9; Māy 222.3;
247.2; certainly the same as the Elapatra (mss.; ed. wrongly
em. Elā°) of Divy 61.4, tho here he is not called a nāga
but one of the four ‘kings’ presiding over the four treasures
(cf. Mv iii.383.18 ff. above), (Divy 61.1) atha catvāro
mahārājāś caturmahānidhisthāḥ, (3--4, vs) Piṅgalaś ca
Kaliṅgeṣu Mithilāyāṃ ca Pāṇḍukaḥ, Elapatraś ca Gān-
dhāre Śaṅkho Vārāṇasīpure. Besides the Pali parallel, DN
comm. above, cf. the 9 treasures of Kubera which include
Śaṅkha and Padma (with presiding personages of the same
names), and among the Jains the 9 treasures of a cakra-
vartin, which in their AMg. forms include piṃgala, paṇḍua
(= pāṇḍuka), and saṃkha; the Skt. forms of these are
recorded at least lexically. Note also in Pali the nāga-
king Erakapatta, of Dhp. comm. iii.231 ff., who however
does not seem to be brought into relation to the ‘treasure’
called in Pali ela (above); but the vss attributed to him,
and the replies to them, in Dhp. comm. are reproduced
in Mv iii.384, see above.
