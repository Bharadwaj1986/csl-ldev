{@? āsphuṭa@}¦, adj., {%clear, clarified, illumined%}: LV 17.3
(prose) tenāvabhāsenāsphuṭa-samānā(ḥ), {%being illumined%}
{%by that light%}. The mg. is certain, and acc. to Lefm. all
mss. read so; but not only is āsphuṭa suspicious in itself;
composition with samānāḥ is also difficult. The expected
reading is °bhāsena sphuṭāḥ samānāḥ.
