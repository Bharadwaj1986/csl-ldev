{@sarvakālaka@}¦ (see also {@sārvakālika@}), adj. with pud-
gala, {%all-black, completely impure%}, said of a delinquent
monk who has gone thru five rites of purification, but
all wrongly done: MSV iii.74.7; 77.6. If one or more of
the five rites is done properly, the others wrongly, the
delinquent remains impure and is called (successively)
{@yadbhūyaskālaka@}, {%mostly black%}; {@upārdhakālaka@}, {%half%}
{%black%}; {@ekadeśakālaka@}; and {@pradeśakālaka@}; if all are
properly done, he is {%pure%}, {@apagatakālaka@}, q.v. In the
virtual repetition, p. 78, {@pradeśakālakaḥ@} is accidentally
omitted, but {@ekadeśakālakaḥ@} (line 13) has the definition
given above to pradeśa-k° (only one of the five rites being
done wrongly), which seems likely to be right. The ms.
several times writes -kālika for -kālaka.
