{@saṃdhi@}¦, m., (in several mgs. substantially the same
as in Skt.), ({@1@}) {%joint%} (= Skt.), as of the body, also {%connexion%}

{%intermediate point%} between one bodhisattva-bhūmi and the
next, saṃdhi-cittaṃ Mv i.91.5, {%the juncture-frame-of-mind%},
of a Bodhisattva passing from one bhūmi to the next;
bhūmi-saṃdhiṣu 97.17, prob. in this mg., but the verse
is corrupt and obscure; (katamaṃ) saṃdhi-cittaṃ bhavati
110.16 (in passing from the 4th to the 5th bhūmi, similarly
18, and 127.15, 18); paryādānaṃ gacchanti, pātāla-saṃdhi-

navigarhaṇa-saṃdhisāmagrī-guṇavarṇaprakāśanaprayoga-
tvāt suśukladanta ity ucyate, where it seems likely
that saṃdhi-sāmagrī, {%the totality of concord (?)%}, is the
opposite of piśunavacana and bheda(mantra); ({@4@}) {%intention%}
(see Senart's note ii.537): naiṣo kṣurapro saṃdhito (abl.,
{%by intention%}) āhato 'si mayā ajānantena Mv ii.222.17 (vs,
so mss., meter impossible, but not improved by Senart's
violent em.); saṃdhito is also read in mss. in the very
similar line 7 above, where saṃdhīto would make the meter
perfect and should prob. be read m.c. (rather than Senart's
em. saṃdahito); possibly same mg. in LV 42.3 (vs) saṃdhi-
pralāpam aśubhaṃ na samācariṣye, {%I shall not commit any%}

not understand the expression); this meaning is given for

(impv.) Laṅk 283.9 (vs); also in {@saṃdhi-nirmocana@},
q.v.; ({@6@}) {%connexion%} with rebirth, (Suzuki) ‘{%attachment%} (to
existence)’, in a passage beginning Laṅk 160.8 ff. in which
Buddha is asked to explain sarvadharma-saṃdhy-artha-
parimocanārtham (9) {%the meaning of attachment (connexion,%}
{%binding) and of emancipation of all states of being%}; in
(sarvadharmāṇāṃ) saṃdhyasaṃdhi-lakṣaṇaṃ (11), asaṃ-
dhi, {%non-attachment%}, replaces parimocana; in 162.9 ff.

cited s.v. {@saṃgati@} 2, in which it appears that saṃdhi,
[Page558-a+ 71]
esp. the three saṃdhayaḥ (above), are, or are correlated
with, the three {@saṃgati@}, these two words being virtual
synonyms in this use; after this, abhūtaparikalpo hi
