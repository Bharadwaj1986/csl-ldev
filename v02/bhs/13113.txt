{@vaṃśa-ghaṭikā@}¦ (see {@ghaṭikā@}), {%bamboo-stick%}, as a
kind of toy (rather than ‘game’, as Index and pw Adden-
dum): Divy 475.19. It may have been {%used%} in a game;
cf. Pali vaṃsaṃ DN i.6.13, comm. i.84.26 = veṇuṃ
ussāpetvā kīḷanaṃ; indeed, the true translation may be
{%stick used in (the game of) vaṃśa%}, instead of the above.
