{@naimittika@}¦, m. (= Pali ne°, both mgs.; from nimitta
plus -ika), ({@1@}) {%one who hints at a desire for a gift%} (from a
lay patron): RP 58.7 °kāḥ; cf. Wogihara, Lex. 21, 24 f.,
and next; ({@2@}) (commonly) {%sign-reader, soothsayer, for-%}
{%tune-teller%} (also {@nimittika, naimitta, °ttaka@}; but these
are much rarer than {@naimittika@}, contrary to Wogihara's
statement, above, that the latter is found in Buddhist
sources only in the LV and Mvy passages; to disprove
this statement, I cite a few of many occurrences, altho
the word is also recorded in Skt.): LV 186.15; Mvy 3793;
Mv ii.32.6; iii.178.17; Divy 132.8; 168.17; 319.14 ff.;
410.18 f.; 474.26; Av i.13.11 etc.; Gv 53.6.
