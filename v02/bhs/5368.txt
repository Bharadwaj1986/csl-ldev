{@? kṣīyati@}¦ (= Pali khīyati), {%is vexed%}; so Senart at
Mv ii.480.2, 4; text in 2 (sā…) tāsām antaḥpurikānāṃ
ruṣyati kṣīyati (but v.l. kṣipati) paribhāṣati, in 4 kiṃ
tuvaṃ asmākaṃ ruṣyasi kṣīyasi (but both mss. kṣipasi
or °pesi) paribhāṣasi (mss. °ṣesi). Since one ms. in 2,
and both in 4, have forms of kṣip, which in normal Skt.
means {%scold, revile%}, it seems at least likely that we should
read kṣipati, °si.See, however, s.vv. {@vivācayati, dhriyati@}.
