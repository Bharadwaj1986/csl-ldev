{@? Khaṣa@}¦, m. pl., cf. {@Khāṣya-@}, prob. = Skt. Khasa,
or Khaśa (cf. {@Svaśa@}), n. of a barbarian people in the north:
MSV ii.31.17 (ff.) Puṣkarasāriṇo rājñaḥ Pāṇḍavā nāma
Khaṣā viruddhāḥ; acc. to N. Dutt's note, khaṣa = {@pra-@}
{@tyantika@}; Tib. cited as mthaḥ ḥkhob = {%barbarian border%}
{%country%}, often applied to Tibet itself, and fitting Skt.
Khasa. I assume that the Pāṇḍavāḥ are meant for the
well-known people of the Skt. epic.
