{@? upakāraṇa@}¦ (cf. AMg. uvagāraṇa = Skt. upakāra?
or for Skt. and Pali upakaraṇa?), in Mmk 48.10 evaṃ
laḍḍukāgarbhoktārakaviśeṣān (? seems corrupt) pūpopa-
kāraṇān sarvadevabhūtagaṇān sarvasattvāṃś ca mantrope-
tān vidhinā niryātayet. We seem to need dat. instead
of acc. forms for °gaṇān and °sattvāmś (as in the following
parallel sentence); with that change, pūpopakāraṇān
might mean {%benefactions consisting of cakes%}, or {%instruments%}
(cf. upakaraṇa) {%of%} (making) {%cakes%}; or, with a mg. character-
istic of upakaraṇa in Pali rather than Skt., {%commodities%}
{%consisting of cakes%}; or finally, if = BHS {@upakaraṇa@} in
Bbh 246.24 (see s.v.), {%food consisting of cakes%}.
