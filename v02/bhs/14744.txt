{@vyūhā, viyūhā, = vyūha@}¦ (2): mahatyā rājavyūhayā
Suv 79.13 (prose); about half the mss. mahatā °vyūhena;
(mahatā rājānubhāvena mahatā rāja-ṛddhīye) mahatā (so
1 ms., v.l. °tāye, Senart em. °tīye) viyūhāye (no v.l.)
mahatīye vibhūṣāye Mv ii.113.13 (prose); in similar list,
mahatā viyūhāye (no v.l.) ii.156.17. I have elected to take
as pl. m. the forms in LV 36.16 (vs), see under {@vyūha@}
(1); the citation there is completed by manasā vicintitā
śrīmān, without significant v.l.; Calc. śrīman, as if voc.
sg., but if voc. it should be pl. (the Bodhisattva, still in
heaven, addresses the Tuṣita gods); if acc. pl., it would
imply that the preceding forms ending in -ā are also acc.
pl., coordinate with phalam idaṃ (śṛṇu-r-asya…) of
next line; all of which would be quite possible in BHS.
