{@muñcati@}¦, {%emits words, speech%}; in Skt. and Pali used
with object vācaṃ or the like, but here absolutely, no
object noun expressed (also {@pramuñcati, vimuñcati@},
in the same context): kalyāṇikāṃ vimuñceta naiva muñ-
ceta pāpikām Ud vii.8 (vācaṃ is clearly understood with
the f. adj., but does not occur in the passage); similarly
