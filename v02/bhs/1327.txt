{@a-paśyanā@}¦ (neg. n. act. to paśyati, cf. {@paśyana,@}
{@anupaśyanā@}), {%the not-seeing%}: SP 137.12 °nayā, {%by not-%}
{%seeing%}; Kern {%as if he were not seeing%}, not quite rightly;
Burnouf is farther from the truth. ‘Sight’ is false, illusory;
one must {%not-see%} to truly see. Confirmed by verse version
SP 143.2; and cf. Laṅk 9.8 ye paśyanti yathādṛṣṭaṃ na
te paśyanti nāyakam.
