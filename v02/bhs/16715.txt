{@sāṃbandhaka@}¦, nt. (to Skt. saṃbandha plus -ka; =
Skt. °dhika), {%an alliance by marriage%}: (evaṃ) kṛtaṃ °kaṃ
Av ii.37.9; evaṃ kṛte °ke 46.4; ms. both times sāvandhak°;
Speyer em. sāṃbandhik°, because this occurs in Skt. and
because ‘the word must be a derivative from saṃbandhin,
not saṃbandha’; I do not understand the second reason,
and the first is irrelevant.
