{@navakarmika@}¦ (= Pali °kammika, said to mean
{%repairer of buildings%}, but see below): Mvy 8735 °kaḥ =
Tib. lag gi bla, which Das defines as {%one who does general%}
{%menial service to the congregation of lamas in a monastery%};
MSV i.235.6, 9; ii.145.13; he was as a rule himself a monk,
but inferior in position and function, as shown by Jm
113.22 (vs) āvāsikaḥ so 'stu mahāvihāre kacaṅgalāyāṃ
navakarmikaś ca (as a punishment). That the navakam-
mika in Pali, too, was low in station among monks is
shown by the story of Sudhamma, Vin. ii.15.30 ff. (āvāsiko
…navakammiko dhuvabhattiko), and navakamme in
Jāt. iv.378.29 seems to mean {%manual labor%} (certainly not
{%repairing%}, since a new structure was being built). I have
found no Pali comm.'s interpretation, but the Pali word
seems to need reexamination. Perhaps lit. {%(one who per-%}
{%forms) new-initiate's work%} (see {@nava@}).
