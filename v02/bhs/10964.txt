{@Buddha@}¦, {%an ‘Enlightened One’%}, passim; Mvy 1 (and
regularly) = Tib. saṅs rgyas; 35 Buddhas before whom
serious offenses are to be confessed by Bodhisattvas,
Śikṣ 169.4, see note. Many long lists of B's in most of the
texts here included; in general, each name in such lists
has been entered in my Dict. But one such list, Mmk
7.24-8.18, has been ignored; the text is very corrupt
and obscure; division of the words is often uncertain;
few of the names are known elsewhere, Five Buddhas
called ‘transcendent’ by P. Mus, Barabudur, p.577 ff.
({%L'origine des Cinq Jina%}; a full discussion here), Dharmas
3 et alibi, see the names {@Vairocana, Akṣobhya, Ratna-@}
{@saṃbhava, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi@}.
