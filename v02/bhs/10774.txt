{@preṣayati, preṣeti@}¦ (cf. Skt. id., Pali peseti, {%sends%}),
with cittaṃ, {%directs%} the thought (with dat., or loc., towards,
see {@saṃpreṣayati@}): cittu preṣeti varāgrabodhaye LV
179.6 (vs). Acc. to Senart, Mv i note 535, preṣayati would
have this same mg. with ellipsis of cittaṃ in Mv i.202.14
= ii.6.11 (vs); and, I would add, surely the same form
(preṣaya) should be read in the same line i.145.17, where
all mss. omit the verb altogether but Senart by em.
inserts prekṣasva, instead of preṣaya of the other passages.
Senart's interpretation of preṣaya seems hardly necessary;
it may mean {%order, direct, command%}; cf. Pali Vin. ii.177.19
(ārāmikā) a-pesiyamānā (pass. pple.), {%not being directed,%}
{%commanded%}; and SP 116.5.
