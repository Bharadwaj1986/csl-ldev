{@āśaya@}¦, as in Skt., and Pali āsaya, {%mental disposition,%}
{%intent%} (La Vallée-Poussin, AbhidhK. iv.24 {%intention%});
common, but not specifically Buddhist, except the adverbs
āśayena {%heartily, earnestly%} RP 12.9 (ms. āśrayena; cf.
adhyāśayena), and āśayataḥ ibid. Mvy 7119; Divy 281.4,
10; Av ii.151.2; Dbh.g. 16(352).11. The mgs. {%abode, basis%}
etc. are also standard Skt. Cf. {@adhyāśaya@}, which is speci-
fically Buddhist. If Senart is right in keeping āsayāni in
Mv iii.400.3, it would have to be understood as = āśayāni,
(evil) {%intentions%} or {%inclinations%}; but see {@āsaya@}. Often cpd.
with {@anuśaya@}, q.v.
