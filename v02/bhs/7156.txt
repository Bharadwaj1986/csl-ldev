{@traividya@}¦, adj., and {@°ya-tā@}, noun (= Pali tevijja,
°ja-tā), (state of) {%possessing the three knowledges%}. In Pali
(see Childers s.v. vijjā and Lévi, Sutrāl. vii.9, note), these
are either (1) knowledge that all is anicca, dukkha, anatta,
or (2) knowledge of former births (pubbenivāsa), of the
(future) rebirths of beings (cutūpapāta), and of the de-
struction of the depravities (āsava-khaya); of these the
first and the third are two of the {@abhijñā@} (Pali abhiññā),
q.v., and the second results from another abhijñā, viz.
divyacakṣus (see s.v. {@upapāda@}), so that these three abhijñā
are identified in BHS as the three vidyā, AbhidhK. LaV-P.
vii.108. So far as I have found, this second of the two Pali
sets is the only one recognized in BHS, where the category
is in any case of very restricted occurrence; I have failed
to record it except in SP and LV. In SP only the adj.
occurs, always associated with ṣaḍabhijña, {%having the six%}
{@abhijñā@}, as in: te traividyāḥ ṣaḍabhijñā(ḥ)…SP 179.17
(prose), and in verses (always separate ṣaḍabhijña from
traividya! text makes them cpd.) 90.7; 129.10; 150.2;
155.2; no such association in LV, where context never
helps in interpretation; adj., traividya (voc.) LV 363.16
(vs); noun, traividyatādhigatā 350.14 (so read with best
mss. for text traividyādh°); °dyatā daśabalena…prāptā
352.17; °tām anuprāptaṃ 353.13 (prose); the last suggests
that in 426.13 (prose) it is necessary to em. to traividyatā-
nuprāpta (text °dyānu°, no v.l.) ity ucyate (said of Buddha).
