{@Bodhisattva-prātimokṣa@}¦, n. of a work: Śikṣ 11.11
etc., common; in 36.15 printed °pratimokṣa, but °prāti° in
Transl. A work called by this name (°kṣa-sūtra) was
published by Nalinaksha Dutt in IHQ 7 (1931).259--286;
but as the editor states, 260, it ‘has very little to do with
the B.Pr.S. cited in the works of Śāntideva’.
