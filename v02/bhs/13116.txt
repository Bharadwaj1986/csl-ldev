{@vaṃśarocanā@}¦ (Skt. Lex. id.; Skt. vaṃśalocana, and
Lex. °nā), {%tabasheer, sugar of bamboo%}: Mvy 5790; in Suv
105.2 (vs) mss. samocakaṃ tu; Nobel em. sarocanā, im-
plausibly; a Chin. version supports vaṃśarocanā, which
should prob. be read, despite the ‘metrical difficulties’
(Nobel) which it causes (omit tu, as a patchword introduced
after the corruption?).
