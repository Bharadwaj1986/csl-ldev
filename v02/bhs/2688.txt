{@ādiśati, (1)@}¦ (cf. Hindi ādes {%salutation%}, late Skt. ādeśa
id., Edgerton, JAOS 38.206 f.), {%salutes, greets%}: °śitavya,
gdve., Mv iii.420.11 (na bhikṣavo) yuṣmābhir ādiśitavyaṃ
bhikṣāyāṃ labdhāyāṃ, {%monks, you must not salute%} (the
[Page094-a+ 71]
donor) {%when you have received alms%}; ({@2@}) (= Pali ādisati,
obj. dakkhinaṃ, dānaṃ), {%assigns%} (the profit from a mer-
itorious act, ordinarily a gift of alms to the Buddha and
his monks; object dakṣiṇām, once dakṣiṇādeśanām; this
profit is, at the desire of the donor, often assigned by the
recipient, ordinarily the Buddha, to the credit of someone
else, e.g. a tormented preta, or the deceased father of the
donor): Divy 85.28--30 bhagavatābhihitaḥ: mahārāja,
kasya nāmnā dakṣiṇām ādiśāmi, kiṃ tavāho svid yena
tavāntikāt prabhūtataraṃ puṇyaṃ prasūtam iti (similarly
86.3, 4, 7, etc.), {%the Lord said: O King, in whose name%}
{%shall I assign the profit of your gift? yours, or that of one%}
{%who has produced more merit than you?%}; Av i.258.13 tato
bhagavān…dakṣiṇām ādiśati (in a verse, 259.1--2,
assigning it to the benefit of pretas); 264.12 bhagavāṃś
ca…dakṣiṇādeśanām ādiśati (as prec.); 272.13 tato
bhagavatā pretasya nāmnā dakṣiṇā ādiṣṭā; but the same
ādiśati may be used when the subject is the donor, as in
a frequent cliché in which a man hopes to have a son who
will assign to him after death the profit of gifts and works
of merit: Divy 99.6--8 asmākaṃ ca (see {@atyatīta@})…
dānāni dattvā puṇyāni kṛtvā nāmnā dakṣiṇām ādiśed,
…{%he would assign the profit%} (of the gifts and virtuous
acts) {%in my name%}; virtually the same Divy 440.30 ādek-
ṣyati; Av i.15.1 and 197.3 etc. ādekṣyate; but elsewhere,
({@3@}) when the donor (not the Buddha) is the subject, the
caus. ādeśayati is used; so in the same cliché just men-
tioned, Divy 2.(15--)16…dakṣiṇām ādeśayiṣyati, (my
son…) {%will cause the profit to be assigned%} (to me); Av
i.264.2--3 putraka…mama nāmnā buddhapramukhaṃ
bhikṣusaṃghaṃ bhojaya dakṣiṇām ādeśaya…; Divy
10.28 (asmākaṃ) ca nāmnā dakṣiṇām ādeśaya (also
addressed by a father to his son). See s.v. {@dakṣiṇādeśanā@}.
