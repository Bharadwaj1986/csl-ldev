{@-cārika@}¦, adj. or subst. m. (= Skt. and Pali -cārin,
ifc.; see also {@piṇḍa-cārika@}), {%moving; practising%}: pattra-
cārikā ṛddhyā harita-cārikā bhājana-cārikāś cāgatāḥ Divy
45.17; similarly 45.20; it seems clear that the reference
[Page228-b+ 71]
is to persons who magically {%ride%} or {%move%} thru the air on
{%leaves%}, some sort of {%plants%} or {%trees%} (harita, cf. Skt. haritaka),
and {%jars%} (bhājana), cf. 45.27--30. Acc. to Burnouf, Introd.
261 note 2, Tib. renders -cārikā(ḥ) by ḥdri ma, which the
Dictt. of Tib. do not interpret satisfactorily; I suggest
dri bo, {%magician%}. Tib. renders harita by śiṅ tshe, ap-
parently some tree or shrub. There is a v.l. -vārika, which
pw 7.365 adopts for bhājana-cārika, identifying it with
°vārika in Mvy 9069, which however means something
like {%superintendent of vessels%} and cannot be intended in
the Divy passage. In Śikṣ 332.4 cārika seems to mean
{%practiser, follower%} (cf. Skt. and Pali cārin), sc. of a heretical
religion.
