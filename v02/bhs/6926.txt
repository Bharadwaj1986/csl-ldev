{@tāla@}¦, nt. (in Skt. only m., and so BHS usually),
{%palm-tree%}: (sarvasmāc ca tālād ratnasūtrād, so read with
Calc. for Lefm. °trā) dvitīye tālam avasaktam abhūt LV
273.22 (prose), {%and from a jewel-thread%} (extending) {%from%}
{%each palm-tree%}, (each) {%palm-tree was attached to the next%}.
As a measure of length or esp. height, {@tāla@}, {%palm-tree%},
occurs also in Skt. (BR), and much oftener in BHS, where
previous translators often erroneously render {%span%}, esp.
in the cpd. sapta-tāla; but this (= Pali satta-tāla) means,
as in Pali, {%seven palm-trees%}, and so tāla regularly (con-
firmed by Tib., regularly śiṅ ta la, {%tāla-tree%}). Acc. to Mv
ii.313.3 ff. a tāla is one-eighth of a krośa, and eight times
a {@pauruṣeya@} 3, q.v. In LV 14.11 the cakra-ratna of the
cakravartin is saptatālam uccaiḥ; in LV 154.5 a metal
figure of a boar (ayasmayī varāhapratimā) measures 7
tālas (read saptatālā as one word); in LV 273.19 a vedikā
is saptatālān uccaistvena; in Av ii.104.4, 14 a throne is
saptatālodgataṃ; in SP 428.10 kūṭāgāram abhiruhya
vaihāyase saptatālamātreṇa, {%having mounted a tower-house%}
{%seven tālas high in the air%}. Most commonly used as a
measure of height to which someone, esp. Buddha, magi-
cally rises in the air; one tāla only, tālamātraṃ (vaihā-
yasam…) Mv i.239.18; iii.107.12, 13; 108.5; 411.13, 15;
oftener sapta-tāla-mātraṃ vaihāyasam abhyudgamya, or
variations on this, SP 459.11; 465.7; LV 18.16 (here a
Pratyekabuddha, rising 7 tālas, passes thru the ‘fire-
element’, tejodhātu, and disappears); 350.20--21; Laṅk
16.6; Divy 252.16.
