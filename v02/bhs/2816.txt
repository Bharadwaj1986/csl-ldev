{@ābhoga@}¦, m. (derived by Leumann, Das nordarische
Lehrgedicht des Buddhismus, AKM 20.1, p. 68, from bhuj
{%bend%}, as {%Anbiegung = Anlehnung%}; an-ā°, {%ohne Anlehnung%}
{%d.h. ohne Rückhalt oder Stützpunkt%}. Some Pali interpreters
also derive from this root, see PTSD. Whatever the ety-
mology, the primary mg. in BHS is clearly {%effort%}; so some
Skt. lexx., = yatna. This also fits at least many Pali
occurrences of ābhoga, but in Pali the word needs more
study; dict. definitions are all unsatisfactory; it is often
bracketed or equated with manasikāra, esp. with cetaso
or cittassa, DN comm. i.122.6--7, perhaps as (mental)
{%effort%}, e.g. Miln. 97.10), {%effort, earnest application%} (directed
towards, loc.): Mvy 2092 = Tib. sgrim pa, ḥjug pa, bzo
(gzo) ba, {%endeavor; setting about; work%}; śīle ābhogaṃ
kṛtvāna, {%having made effort for%} (in regard to) {%morality%} Mv
ii.358.7; 360.9; ekāntaśukleṣv eva karmasv ābhogaḥ kara-
ṇīyaḥ, {%one must strive for…%} Divy 23.30--24.1; 55.12; 193.15;
289.23; sarvābhogavigato 'nābhogadharmatāprāptaḥ kāya-
vākcittautsukyāpagataḥ Dbh 64.15--16, {%rid of all%} (inter-
ested) {%effort, arrived at a state of effortless%} ({%impassive%}, see
{@anābhoga@}) {%condition, free of bodily, vocal, mental desires%}
(said of the Bodhisattva); in Dharmas 118, list of six
‘hindrances’ ({@āvaraṇa@}) to samādhi: kausīdya, māna,
śāṭhya, auddhatya, anābhoga, satyābhoga; here anābhoga
{%lack of effort%} has a bad sense, not a good one as in Dbh
64.16; satyābhoga is obscure (saty-ābhoga, {%effort directed%}
{%towards something concretely existing%} as distinguished from
abstract goals? if satya-ābhoga, as cpd., I do not understand
what it could mean as a {%hindrance to samādhi%}). See {@anā-@}
{@bhoga, sābhoga@}, both clearly supporting mg. {%effort%}.
