{@Etadagra@}¦, n. of a work, or section of one, which =
or contains the Dakṣiṇāvibhaṅga sūtra: Karmav 156.12
Bhagavataitadagre Dakṣiṇāvibhaṅge sūtra uktam. It is
not the Etadagga-vagga AN i.23 ff. (cf. {@Agratā-sūtra@});
nor does Lévi's identification with AN Book 4, No. 15
(ii.17) seem certain, since the precise quotation does not
occur there.
