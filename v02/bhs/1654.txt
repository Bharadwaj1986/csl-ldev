{@abhiṣyandati@}¦ (cf. prec. and following entries), ({@1@})
{%overflows%} with evil emotion, specifically anger or malice:
Mv i.30.5 (asurāḥ) kupyanti vyāpadyanti abhiṣyandanti;
({@2@}) some form or derivative of this verb is intended in
Mv iii.311.1, which Senart misunderstands; the mg. must
be {%becoming inflated%} (with evil bodily humors), cf. {@abhi-@}
{@ṣyaṇṇa@}; this condition of the Buddha's body resulted
from his first meal after the seven-weeks fast. The next
sentence says that Śakra brought harītakī, a purgative
medicine, so that {%his humors might become pacified, restored%}
{%to ease%}, dhātūnāṃ sukhaṃ (em. to mukhaṃ by Senart!)
bhaviṣyati.The exact reading in 1 is uncertain; possibly
tathā abhiṣyanditam, impersonal, {%inflation, over-exuberance%}
(of humors) {%was caused%}.
