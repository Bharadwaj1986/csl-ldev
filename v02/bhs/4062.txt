{@ekāṃśa@}¦, adj. and subst. (m.? cf. the following items;

every passage cited could be adj., and in some surely is
so; not in these mgs. in Skt.), ({@1@}) {%absolute, complete;%}

okāśam for ek°, in accord with the Pali corresp. Jāt.
v.150.6, 12 okāsam anuggahāya, but {%make absolute assur-%}
{%ance%} (of a state of grace attained) is exactly what the
context seems to require; the sense is much better than
[Page154-a+ 71]
with the Pali okāsam, and I suspect that the latter is a
distortion of an original which agreed with Mv. (As noted
by Francis and Dutoit, karomi must be read for karohi
in Jāt. v.150.12.)
