{@? hrāsi@}¦ (for hrāse, loc. of hrāsa, {%diminution?%}), is
obscure to me; occurs five times in a series of śloka vss
(in many of which both meter and sense are bad, as the
text is printed) in Mmk, evidently dealing with astro-
nomical portents: tato hrāsi madhyāhne (submetrical! as
4th syllable from end, -i could be m.c. for -e) aparāhne
divākare Mmk 276.6; tamo (read tato with all the rest ?
or contrariwise, should they all be emended to tamo for
tato ?) hrāsi-gate bhānoḥ kṣmākampo yadi jāyate ib. 11;
tato hrāsi yāme vai (submetrical) calite vasumatī tadā
(! hypermetric) 277.1; tato hrāsi yāmānte (submetrical)
dṛśyate karma dāruṇam 3; tato hrāsi-madhye tu (sub-
metrical) ante yāme prajāyate 17.
