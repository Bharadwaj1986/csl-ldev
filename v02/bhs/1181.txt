{@antodaka@}¦, adj. (for antar(r) or Pali anto, {%within%},
plus (u)daka {%water%}, prepos. cpd.), {%within the water%}: Mv
iii.318.7 (prose) antodakāni (utpalāni etc.); in Mv ii.121.9
antodake, perhaps {%in%} (a place that is within the) {%water%};
this could be two words, = Skt. antar udake, but the
parallel suggests that it too is a cpd.
