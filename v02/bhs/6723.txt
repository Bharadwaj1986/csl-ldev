{@jyotika, (1)@}¦ at end of Bhvr. cpd. = Skt. jyotis, {%light%};
ajyotika in garbhagṛhe °ke Mv ii.444.9 (prose), {%without%}
{%light%}; ({@2@}) ? questionable reading in Mv ii.318.15 (vs),
text jyotikāṃ ca (mss. °kaṃ vā, or jyotiṃ ca vā) maṇira-
tanāṃ grahetvā; some name of a jewel is concealed here,
but jyotika does not seem right; the meter is bad with
either ms. reading. Perhaps jyotiṣkaraṃ maṇi°, which
improves the meter; Finot, Lap. ind. 138, notes jyotiṣkara
as n. of a jewel. Or else read jyotīrasaṃ (or °sāṃ = °sān);
this is known as n. of a jewel in Skt., and in Pali as jotirasa,
AMg. joirasa.
