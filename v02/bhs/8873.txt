{@Padmābha@}¦, n. of a former Buddha: Mv i.136.17.
(In Mmk 452.12 prob. adj., {%colored like a lotus%}, as in Skt.
[Schmidt, Nachträge], agreeing with Mahāpadmo ['tha
nāgendraḥ padmābhaś…], rather than n. of another
nāga-prince; cf. 452.14 where padmābhau, dual, is certainly
an adj., referring to Vāsuki and Takṣaka of line 13.)
