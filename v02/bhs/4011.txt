{@? ṛdhyati@}¦, perhaps in transitive sense (so Vedic, not
Class. Skt.), {%makes perfect, makes successful%}: LV 178.10
(vs) (svargāmṛtadvāra muñcahī) ṛddhyahi (so Lefm., em.;
mss. ṛddhyabhi-, ṛddho bhi-, ṛddhyehi, ṛddhyebhiḥ; Calc.
ṛddhi hi, Foucaux ṛddhihi as impv.) śīlavato cintitaṃ.
Tib. is confused in order but if I understand correctly it
reads for this phrase: tshul khrims ldan paḥi bsam pa
ḥgrub ḥgyur gyis, which seems to support an impv.:
{%make to become accomplished the thought of%} (the) {%one endowed%}
{%with morality%}.
