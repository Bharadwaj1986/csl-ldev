1 {@saha-@}¦ (Skt.), indecl., as prior member of a cpd.,
or acc. to some also with a following separate abl., to
be rendered {%immediately upon%} or {%after%}, or the like, of
succession in time so close as to be spoken of as contem-
poraneous; ({@1@}) with foll. abl., as in Pali saha parinibbānā
DN ii.156.35, taken as two words by ed. and Andersen,
Reader, Glossary, {%immediately after%} (Buddha's) {%nirvāṇa%};
Senart, note on Mv i.24.10, and Weller 21, take such
BHS forms as cpds., and I am inclined to follow them,
largely because of the cases listed under (2); but saha
seems to govern a prec. abl., in associative mg., in Ind.
Spr. 1488 aiśvaryāt saha saṃbandhaṃ na kuryāt, {%one should%}
{%not make alliance with royalty%}: saha-śravaṇād eva, {%immedi-%}
{%ately upon hearing%}, LV 62.12; 253.20; bodhisattvamātuḥ
saha-darśanād eva 71.19--20; saha-pratilambhād 72.7, {%as%}
{%soon as they received it%}; te dāni saṃmūrcchitvā saha-vedanā
prapatanti Mv i.24.10 (but this might be taken as an
ordinary Bhvr. of Skt. type, {%with, accompanied by, pain%},
n. pl. m.; Senart understands abl.); ({@2@}) certainly as prior
member of cpds, followed by a noun, either an adverbial
acc., dīpaṃkarasya saha-darśanaṃ LV 359.10 (vs), {%imme-%}
{%diately at the sight of D%}., or in further composition with
another noun, tasyāś ca saha-nirgamana-kāle Śikṣ 72.10,
{%and at the very time when it comes forth%}; oftener with a
following ppp., (ekaḥ pradīpo…) praveśyate, sa saha-
praveśito ({%as soon as it is put in%})…tamondhakāraṃ
vidhamayati Śikṣ 178.3; in loc. abs., te saha-pratiṣṭhāpite
pāṇau LV 72.5, {%they, as soon as%} (Māyā's) {%hand was placed%}
(on their heads)…; sahodgate 'ruṇe Śikṣ 65.7, {%immediately%}
{%after sunrise%}; a loc. abs. would be expected in the next,
but instead a ‘pendant’ ṅom. is used, syntactically discon-
nected with what follows, sahapravartitaṃ cedaṃ…
dharmacakraṃ SP 179.14 (prose), {%and as soon as this wheel%}
{%of the Law was set in motion…%}
