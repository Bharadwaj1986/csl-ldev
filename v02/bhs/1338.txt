{@apasvāpana@}¦, nt. (no form or derivative of apa-svap
is otherwise recorded; perhaps hyper-Skt. for ava-svāpana,
see {@o-svāpana@} and {@ava-svāpayati@}), {%going to sleep%} or
{%sleeping%}: Mvy 6639 = Tib. gñid kyis log pa; LV 217.7
°nam akurutām, (two gods) {%caused a going-to-sleep%} (of
the people of Kapilavastu). We should expect a caus.
mg., {%putting to sleep%}; and this may be the mg. in the LV
passage ({%made a putting to sleep%}); but the Tib. is very
definitely non-caus., and Das cites apasvāpana for the
same Tib.
