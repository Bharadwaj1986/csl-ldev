{@ṣaḍvārgika@}¦, m. pl. (= prec. two and Pali chab-
baggiya), {%members of the group of six (monks)%}, see Childers
and PTSD: Mvy 9255 = Tib. drug sde. Their names are
given 9471--6: Nanda, Upananda, Punarvasu, Chanda,
Aśvaka, Udāyin; the Pali list agrees only in part. Nanda
and Upananda also belong to this group in Divy; see s.v.
{@Nandopananda@}. In Pali they seem to be represented as
followers of the Buddha, though very imperfect ones,
often transgressing rules of propriety. In BHS, at least
in Divy, they seem to be heretics from the Buddhist
standpoint.
