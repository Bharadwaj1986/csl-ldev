{@? -lambaka@}¦, adj., only ifc., (like Skt. vara) {%excellent,%}
{%fine%}: = {@lañcaka@}, with which it varies in mss. of Mv;
see Senart's notes i.466 f., ii.545, 572; Senart varies in
his procedure; in ii.264.6 he em. mss. -lambako to -lañca-
kam; -lambaka is found oftener in Mv mss., but in view
[Page461-b+ 71]
of Pali -lañcaka should perh. be emended to this always:
pārthiva-lambaka, {%excellent king%}, Mv i.115.5; nara-lambaka,
{%excellent man, best of men%} (usually of the Buddha), i.154.18;
156.6, 18; 191.5 (three mss. -lañcaka); ii.26.15; tṛṇarāśi-
lambako, mss. (except tṛṇakāśi-), ii.264.6 (see above).
