{@? viruta@}¦, ppp.-adj., in LV 337.15 (vs) seems to mean
{%surpassing%}; so Tib. ḥdas pa (normally = Skt. ati-kram-):
śakyo nāhaṃ tvatsādṛśyair bahubhir api gaṇana-virutair
(no v.l.) drumāt praticālituṃ, {%I cannot be made to retreat%}
{%from the Tree%} (of enlightenment) {%even by many such as%}
{%you%} (Māra), {%surpassing count%}. The word seems surely
corrupt but I have not thought of a good em.; ti-(for ati-)
might be read for vi-, but what -ruta represents escapes
me; perh. -gata? Foucaux, Notes 182, cites a v.l. viratai.
