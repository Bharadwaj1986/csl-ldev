{@chandaka, (1)@}¦ nt. (= Pali id.; from chanda plus
ka; see also {@chanda-yācaka@}), {%‘free-will offering’, general%}
{%collection of alms%} for the community of monks, made by
going the rounds of the town and inviting subscriptions
from all citizens (Av ii.39.4 ff. describes this); chandakāni
Av i.269.9; otherwise only {@chandaka-bhikṣaṇa@} (nt.) in
same mg., MSV i.61.19; ii.77.15; Av i.257.8, 11; 313.9;
314.2, 4; 317.16; ii.39.4 ff.; in i.264.2 (see Speyer's Index)
read chandaka-(ed. chandana)-bhikṣaṇa (ms. and ed.
bhikṣa; but the missing -ṇa is read in line 7 below); ({@2@})
in Av ii.55.3…indriyair avikalatvasya kuśaladharma-
chandakasya āścaryādbhuto loke prādurbhāvaḥ, Speyer,
Index, renders -chandaka by {%gathering%} (of merit); but cf.
Pali dhamma-chanda, {%desire for the Law%}, opp. to kāma-
chanda, {%desire for lusts%}; this is certainly the word involved;
either chandaka = chanda (ka svārthe), or, perhaps better,
read -chandatvasya, which matches the preceding series
of nouns in -tva-sya, {%the appearance in the world of a state%}
{%of desiring meritorious%} (or, {%felicitous%}) {%dharma%} (Law, or
states of being ?) {%is a prodigious marvel%}; ({@3@}) in Mvy 2225
text tīvreṇa chandakaḥ, presumably adj., {%desiring (vehe-%}
{%mently)%}; but v.l. chandena, and so Mironov without v.l.
(also Index of Kyoto ed. lists this reference under chanda,
not under chandaka); this is prob. the true reading:
{%with vehement desire%} {@(chanda); (4)@} n. of the Bodhisattva's
charioteer (in Pali Channa; here rarely {@Chanda@}, q.v.);
sometimes even when the meter seems to demand Chanda,
Chandaka is written, as in Mv i.154.9; this is the regular
form in prose and vs; Mv i.154.5 (prose), 6, 9; 155.14;
ii.25.12 (prose); 114.5 (prose); 159.12 ff.; 189.1 ff.; iii.91.7;
262.8; LV 94.13; 95.10; 123.8; 210.3 ff.; 228.17 ff.; 237.18;
Divy 391.22; sent with Kālodāyin by Śuddhodana as
messenger to Buddha after his enlightenment, Mv ii.233.
