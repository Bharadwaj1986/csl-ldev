{@saṃpravutta@}¦, ppp. (semi-MIndic for Skt. saṃprokta;
see {@pravuccati@}), {%declared, said%}: both edd. SP 129.10, 12
(vss); KN state that all Nep. mss. read saṃpravṛttā,
which could be defended as a hyper-Sktism, but Kashgar
rec. pravucyate (in 10 corruptly pramuc°); the mg. is
confirmed by 129.14 and 130.4, close parallels, which read
pravuccati (°te) or °cya°.
