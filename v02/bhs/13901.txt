{@? vipaṃsayati@}¦ (see {@paṃs°@}), {%defiles%} (a woman, sexu-
ally); so I would read in Gv 335.2 (vs): (adharmarāgeṇa
narā hi raktāḥ) nāryaḥ kumāryaḥ…vipaṃsayanti (text
viṣaṃ sapanti) sma purā prasajya; the em. is graphically
simple, and the text seems senseless; to be sure I have
found no other case of vi-paṃs-.
