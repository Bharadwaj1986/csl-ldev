pa(t)tyeva vyākṛtaḥ (ed. °tāḥ, doubtless misprint): prati-
pattyā iva, {%as it seems by his intellectual realization%} (so Skt.
pratipatti), or {%with confidence due to experience%} (so AMg.
paḍivatti); the ed. em. to pratipadyeva, stating in note
that Tib. reads sṅa nas, which means {%formerly%} and which
I cannot relate to either reading. Is there a corruption?
