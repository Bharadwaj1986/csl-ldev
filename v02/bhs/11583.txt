{@manyate@}¦ (= Skt. id., Pali maññati), {%thinks good,%}
{%approves%}; as in Pali phrase yassa dāni kālaṃ maññasi (see
PTSD s.v. maññati), so yasyedāni (yasya dāni) kālaṃ
manyaso, {%whatever you think appropriate%}, in formula of
consent; in Mv several times preceded by sukhī bhava(tu),
see {@sukhin@}, the whole meaning {%all right, be it as you say%}:
sukhī bhava…manyase Mv i.320.15; 321.12; in 323.22 f.
the Buddha Kāśyapa replies to King Kṛkin's invitation
by messenger, sukhī bhavatu Kṛkī…yasya dāni kālaṃ
manyase (2d person!); in 324.6 (without any sukhī bhava)
adhivāseti ca bhagavāṃ K° yasyedāni kālaṃ manyase;
so also in 324.10, 15 (yasya, 15 adds dāni, bhagavaṃ
[mss. °vāṃ] kālaṃ manyase); in 325.7, consenting to
dwell in Kṛkin's new palace, the Buddha K. says: sukhī
bhava yasyedānīṃ kālaṃ manyase.
