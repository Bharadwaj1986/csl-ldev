[{@vikṣāntam@}¦ (as if ppp. to vi-kṣamati = Skt. kṣamati),
{%pardoned%}: in LV 168.14 (vs) all mss. tac ca vi°, Lefm. em.
ti (= te) kṣ°, {%and that was forgiven by you%}; the em. is surely
right, because (1) no vi-kṣam- in this sense is recorded
anywhere; (2) in 18 below taṃ ca ti kṣāntaṃ is read in
all mss. in a precisely similar phrase; (3) Tib. also supports
the em., khyod kyis ({%by you%}) de dag ({%those things%}) bzod
({%pardoned%}).]
