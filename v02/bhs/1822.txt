[{@amuñciyaṃ@}¦, Senart's em. at Mv i.184.9, apparently
understood as neg. gdve. from muñcati, {%not to be escaped%}
{%from%}. But mss. a-muñciya (one °yaḥ; at end of line of
vs), and this is prob. to be kept, as neg. ger.: {%not having%}
{%got rid of%}, i.e. {%if one does not get rid of%} (this evil thought).]
