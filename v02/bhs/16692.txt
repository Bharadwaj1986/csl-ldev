{@? sābhīyati@}¦, acc. to Tib. {%delays in making%}: (paro-
pasthānaṃ) °yati, abhinandati Śikṣ 152.7 (so ms., ed. em.
[Page591-b+ 71]
so 'bhiyāti, which is manifestly impossible); Tib. cited
as gzhan gyi rim gro bya bar sdod ciṅ, {%being slow to do%}
{%honor to others%}; abhinandati, doubtless, {%he approves%} (defends
such behavior); this is a kind of Māra-karman, {%evil behavior%}.
The word is obscure and may well be corrupt; I do not see
any way of relating it to AMg. sāhī, {%wicket-gate%} (see Sheth),
or Deśī sāhī, {%way, road%}.
