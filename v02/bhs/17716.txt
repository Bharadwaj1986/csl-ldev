{@hirodaka@}¦ (not ahiro°!), Divy 384.24, acc. to Note
p. 709 hirā-udaka, {%vein-water, blood%}: but this is quite im-
plausible. The phrase is hirodakasikatāpiṇḍair aṇḍakāṣṭhe-
bhyo (see this) 'pi asārataratvaṃ kāyasyāvetya, {%realizing%}
{%that the body is more worthless even than eggshells(?) full%}
{%of%} (? so Burnouf, Introd. 376) {%lumps of sand, water, and%}
{%gravel%}. (Burnouf, {%pleines de boules de sable faites avec des%}
[Page620-b+ 71]
{%larmes de serpent%}.) The instr. -piṇḍair is apparently asso-
ciative, with the following word; perhaps render {%eggshells%}
{%along with lumps%} etc., {%eggshells%} (if Burnouf is right) being
likewise symbolic of worthlessness, and also fragility. In
Deśīn. 8.66 is noted hilā, {%sand%} (vālukā); hirā is prob.
equivalent to this. It would fit with sikatā, and udaka
could perhaps be used as a symbol of worthlessness.
