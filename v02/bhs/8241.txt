[{@nitya@}¦, acc. to Senart used as synonym for nirvāṇa,
Mv ii.140.16 (vs), see his note, comparing ii.144.4. But
this seems hardly sufficient evidence, and I have been
unable to find elsewhere in Pali or BHS or Skt. any such
use of nitya. Text: nityāntareṇa manasā kṛtamokṣa-
buddhiḥ, mārgaṃ (? mss. āryaṃ) va (mss. ca) tāva mama
putra cara prasīda, jīvāmi yāvac ca ahaṃ (so mss.)…,
(Śuddhodana pleads with the Bodhisattva to wait for his
own death before renouncing the world; text in part
uncertain;) {%with constantly internal mind fixing your will%}
{%on salvation%} (i.e. keeping it to yourself, not doing any-
thing about it yet)…{%as long as I live…%} The word nitya,
at any rate, seems to have its Skt. meaning.]
