{@pāramitā@}¦ (= Pali id., to prec. plus -tā; in Pali
synonym of pāramī or °mi in all respects), ({@1@}) = prec.,
{%mastery, supremacy, perfection%}, in general sense, cpd. with
preceding attribute indicating the field of mastery:
garbhāvakrānti-°tā Mv i.214.12 = ii.17.11, {%supremacy%}
{%(supremeness, perfection) as regards entry into the womb%};
sarvakuśaladharma-vaśibhāva-°tāṃ Mv ii.261.7; jina-°tāve
402.22 ({%of the Jinas%}); uttama-damatha-śamatha-°tā-prāpta
Mv iii.64.6 (cf. i.237.12 s.v. {@pārami@}); sarvacetovaśi-(see
{@vaśin@})-parama-°tā-prāpta LV 425.22 (prose); in LV 376.18
(vs), read probably daśabalaguṇa-pāramita-(m.c. for °tā,
which all mss. read; Lefm. em. °mi-)-prāptaṃ; possibly
to be classed with (2) below are mahopāyakauśalya-
jñāna-(29.10 adds darśana-)-parama-°tā-prāpta SP 29.10;
77.8 (both prose); ({@2@}) one or more of a technical list of
(usually six, sometimes ten, rarely five or seven) {%supreme%}
{%virtues%}, of Buddhas, or (to be cultivated by) Bodhisattvas;
usually rendered {%perfection%}; Burnouf, Lotus 544 (App.
VII deals with this category) {%vertu transcendante%}; the lit.
mg. was surely {%supremacy: (five)%} SP 334.2 °tāḥ pañca
(and pañca is v.l. for ṣaṭ ca SP 142.7); pañcasu °tāsu SP
332.10 (prose), listed in the foll. as dāna, śīla, kṣānti,
vīrya, dhyāna; but a sixth, prajñā-p°, is separately
mentioned after the list in 333.1; ({%six%}) listed, as just
cited from SP 332.10 ff., Dharmas 17 (cf. 18 cited below);
Mv iii.226.2 ff.; Divy 476.2 ff.; Bbh 4.13 ff.; 58.16 f.;
Laṅk 237.6; Sūtrāl. xvi.2 and 3, comm.; described in
brief statements Śikṣ 187.5--15; in Kv 50.16 ff. with
substitution of dhairya for vīrya; without listing, but
with number 6, SP 17.15; 142.7 (v.l. pañca, above);
256.10; 259.3; 262.1; 264.10; Divy 95.19; 265.2; 490.16,
[Page342-a+ 71]
18 Av i.7.4; 16.13; Suv 37.13; 42.7; RP 21.7; ({%seven%})
the above six plus upayakauśalya-(LV mahopā° and adds
parama-)-paramitā SP 457.11--12; LV 8.2--3; also LV
34.20 ff. (with upāyakauśalaṃ); ({%ten%},) the above seven
(with upāya for upāyakauśalya in Mvy, Dharmas [upāyaṃ,
nom.!], Gv) plus praṇidhāna (Dharmas praṇidhi), bala,
jñāna, Mvy 913--923; Dharmas 18 (immediately after 17
which lists the six); Bbh 371 5 ff.; and in Gv 295.10--25
where, curiously, the same list is given but called {@mahā-@}
{@vitānadharma@}, q.v., instead of pāramitā; in Pali, be it
noted, the list is (so far as has been recorded) always {%ten%}
in number, but not quite the same as in BHS: dāna,
sīla, nekkhamma, paññā, viriya, khanti, sacca, adhiṭṭhāna,
mettā (or metti, Childers), upe(k)khā; in Pali they are
called pāramī as well as °mitā; note further a list of ten
jñāna-pāramitā-vihāra in Gv 537.11 ff., not noted else-
where, seemingly a nonce-elaboration of the tenth (jñāna)
pāramitā; pāramitā without indication of number, LV
274.21 (sarva-°tāsu pāraṃgataḥ); Bhad 19; individual
members of the category, dhyāna-p° SP 335.10; dāna-p°
Mv i.102.5; esp. frequent is {@prajñā-p°@}, q.v., Mv iii.67.4;
LV 179.14--15; 427.17; and passim in ŚsP, AsP, and other
works of this school which makes prajñā-p° its central
point; the word is rendered in Tib. pha rol tu phyin pa,
{%going to the other shore%}, a fantastic etymological rendering,
as if from pāram plus a form of root i; often forms of
(pari-) pūrayati, and noun or adj. derivs., are used governing
pāramitā, e.g. SP 256.10 (°tānāṃ paripūryai); Kv 50.16 ff.
(each °tā paripūrayitavyā)
