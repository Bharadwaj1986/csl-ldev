<L>4431<pc>167,2<k1>कपाट<k2>कपाट
{@kapāṭa@}¦, in LV 376.13 (vs), to be read approximately:
nīvaraṇa-kapāṭāś ca pañca mayehā pradāritā sarve, perh.
{%all the five doors%} (gates, as obstacles) {%of the hindrances have%}
{%been cleft by me here%}. Note however that AMg. kavāḍa =
kapāṭa is a homonym of kavāḍa = kapāla; I suspect that
the latter is really meant here (falsely Sktized), in some
such sense as {%hard shells%}.
