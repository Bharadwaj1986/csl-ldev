{@Subhūti, (1)@}¦ n. of a Śākya of Devaḍaha, father of
Māyā: Mv i.355.15; 356.5; ii.18.7; ({@2@}) (= Pali id., a thera)
n. of a disciple of Buddha, a sthavira: Mvy 1035; SP
2.7; 100.1; 146.13; 148.5; 149.6; LV 1.17; Divy 361.19;
Sukh 2.9; the Subhūti of Av chap. 91, ii.128.3 ff., has a
story showing little resemblance to the Pali story of
Subhūti, but both are entitled ‘chief of disciples that are
araṇāvihārin (see {@araṇa@})’, or in Pali araṇa°; Vaj 19.14
etc. 26.17; Su° is also first of dākṣiṇeya disciples, Karmav
161.18, as also in Pali of dakkhiṇeyya (in AN i.24.8--9
both titles are given him); the same as the Pali personage
is doubtless meant also in KP 141.1 ff.; and Śikṣ 146.8
(from Dharmasaṃgīti-sūtra) and, all from the {@Bhagavatī@},
q.v., Śikṣ 202.8; 210.3 (= ŚsP 1430.5); 262.12; ({@3@}) n. of
a Bodhisattva (cf. {@Subhūmi@}): Mmk 461.6; ({@4@}) n. of a
