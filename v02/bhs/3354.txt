{@-uttaka@}¦, adj. ifc., perhaps {%made, produced%}: Mv ii.457.14
(prose) hastiśālāya paṭalāni ghanāni mahantāni bahujana-
uttakāni, (when a fire had broken out in the elephant-
stables)…{%the thatches of the elephant stable, thick, great,%}
{%made by many people…%} This assumes a ka-extension of
AMg. -utta in deva-utta, bambha-utta, {%produced (created)%}
{%by (the) god(s), by Brahmā%} (see citation in Sheth s.v. utta).
The origin of the word is obscure; Sheth and Ratnach.
regard it as identical with Skt. upta, {%sown%}. Senart has
no suggestion as to mg. or etym.
