{@pratyuddharati@}¦ (to praty-ud- with Skt. har-, not
used in this sense in Skt.; Pali paccuddharati is usually
[Page378-a+ 71]
wrongly interpreted; it means {%removes%} [water, or coloring,
with a cloth], Vin. ii.122.37 and 151.26; see also next
items; the range of mg. in Pali and BHS, for the whole
group, is something like {%remove, take away, take back,%}
{%withhold, restrain%}), {%holds back, restrains, moderates%}: °dhareti
or °dharesi, to be read for mss. °dharehi (Senart em.
°dhāreti), Mv iii.339.3, see s.v. {@samajya@}. In MSV ii.156.5
(at the kaṭhina rite) yuṣmābhiḥ svaka-svakāni cīvarāṇi
pratyuddhartavyānīti (prob. read so, text pratyudvar°),
{%you%} (monks) {%are to receive back your several robes%}.
