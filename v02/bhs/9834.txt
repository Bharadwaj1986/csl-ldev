{@prakāra?@}¦ in SP 146.5 (vs) puṣpaiḥ (so all mss., KN
em. puṣpa-, kept by WT without note) prakāraiḥ sama-
laṃkṛtaṃ ca; acc. to Tib. {%adorned with many flowers%} (me
tog maṅ pos). On the face of the reading of the mss. and
the Tib. rendering, prakāra should be an adj., {%many%}; it is
otherwise known only as a noun, {%kind, sort%}. KN's em.
hardly helps; {%with kinds of flowers%} could not, so far as I
know, serve as a substitute for {%with many kinds…%}; for
this we should expect bahu-, nānā-, or the like, modifying
prakāra. I have thought of reading pravāraiḥ, taking it
as = pravaraiḥ, {%excellent%}, with ā for a m.c.; but Tib. does
not support this.
