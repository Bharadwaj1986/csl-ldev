{@śiṣyate@}¦, could be considered normal Skt. pass. to
śās-, {%is instructed, learns%} (with acc.): (dārakasahasrāṇi…)
lipiṃ °ante sma LV 127.4 (prose; all mss.; Calc. śikṣante).
The prec. and foll. items show that, acc. to persistent
tradition, LV (and esp. in this vicinity) uses forms in
śiṣy- for Skt. and usual BHS śikṣ-; those which Weller
notices he regards as mere corruptions for śikṣ- (41, line 1);
but it is not impossible that the word śiṣya is concerned
in some or all of them, even in this, which could be a
denom. In śiṣyā(-pada), for śikṣā-, the influence of śiṣya
could only have been exerted in secondary blending. These
substitutions may also have phonetic aspects (ṣ for kh
for kṣ, § 2.26).
