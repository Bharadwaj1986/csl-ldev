{@khu-ssa@}¦, cpd. particle, acc. to Senart = Skt. khalu
svid: Mv ii.184.8 (vs) mā khu-ssa me nāga kṛtaṃ na jāne,
{%do not, O nāga, fail to recognize%} (gratefully) {%what I have%}
{%done%} (for you). In Pali -ssu, -su, -si occur for svid (Geiger
22; 111.1); PTSD s.v. su^3 states that sa and assa occur,
allegedly for Skt. sma, but no such forms are cited in
their alphabetic positions in PTSD, nor have I found
any other record of them. Cf. {@sva@} (?).
