{@mānatva@}¦, nt. (also {@mānāpya@}, q.v.; = Pali mānatta),
a kind of penance which is superimposed, after {@parivāsa@},
on a monk guilty of a saṃghāvaśeṣa offense which he has
concealed: Prāt 487.11--12 bhikṣuṇā…mānatvaṃ (12)
caritavyaṃ bhavati, cīrṇa-mānatvo ({%after he has undergone%}
{%the m°%}) bhikṣur…; for {@mānāpya@}, Mvy 8652--5, v.l.
mānatva (so Index; ed. mānātva), but Mironov mānāpya
without v.l.; Tib. renders Mvy mgu bar bya ba, {%making%}
{%glad%} (Das = ārādhanā); Chin. {%respectful behavior%}; this
accords with the Pali comm. (629.29) on the Vin. passage
(iii.186.15 f., bhikkhunā…bhikkhu-mānattāya paṭi-
pajjitabbaṃ, ciṇṇamānatto bhikkhu…) corresponding to
Prāt 487.11--12 above; the comm. says, bhikkhu-mānattāyā
ti bhikkhūnaṃ mānanabhāvāya, ārādhanatthāyā (cf. Das
on Tib. above) ti vuttaṃ hoti; it thus appears that,
according to both northern and southern tradition, this
penance consisted in, or at least involved, some kind of
ceremonial homage paid by the culprit to the general
community of monks. This can be interpreted as supporting
the apparent etym., māna-tva, {%condition of%} (paying) {%respect%}.
