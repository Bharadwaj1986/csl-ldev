<L>8791<pc>316,1<k1>पटु<k2>पटु
[{@paṭu@}¦ is sometimes written by error for Skt. paṭṭa,
[Page316-b+ 71]
esp. in the sense of (honorary) {%fillet%} or {%turban%}; or even
seemingly for Skt. paṭa, see s.v. {@paṭa@} 3, and Kv below.
In LV 275.4 most mss. point to °paṭv-ābaddha, but it
seems we must read with Lefm. vimukti-paṭṭābaddho,
{%bound%} (decorated) {%with the honorary-turban of emancipation%}
(Tib. confusedly rnam par grol paḥi, = vimukti, thabs
thob pa, acc. to Foucaux {%il a trouvé le moyen de…%}, but
thabs might well indicate paṭu as the BHS reading);
in LV 367.9; 430.10 and 13 both edd. paṭṭa, some mss.
in all, all mss. in 430.10 paṭu; in Kv 84.20 text muktā-
paṭu-dāma-kalāpa-pralambitāni, but read paṭṭa or else
paṭa as in 87.5 muktāhāra-paṭa-dāma-kalāpa-pralam-
bitāni.]
