{@abhigīta@}¦, in gāthābhigīta, (ppp.) subst. (in Skt. as
ppp., rare; Pali only in the same cpd., gāthābhi°, but its
meaning is disputed, see CPD; in any case it certainly
does not have the mg. it has in BHS), either dvandva,
{%verses and songs%} (so Burnouf and Kern on SP 191.3), or
(more likely) tatpuruṣa, {%recitation of verses%} (so apparently
B. and K. on SP 303.2, and Régamey on Samādh); only
in instr. °gītena (in SP 191.3 v.l. °gītebhi), {%with recitation%}
{%of (a) verse(s)%}; in every case except SP 191.3 followed
by one or more stanzas, to which this noun clearly refers:
SP 191.3 °tena abhistaviṃsu (sc. Buddhaṃ); 303.2 °tenai-
tam evārthaṃ paripṛcchati sma; Gv 275.25 buddhadar-
śanaṃ °tena saṃvarṇayām āsa; Divy 83.9; Samādh 8.20;
MSV ii.104.14.
