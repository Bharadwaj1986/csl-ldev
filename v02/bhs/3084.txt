{@āsevaka@}¦, or {@°kā@}, some kind of garment: SP 283.9
(vs), cited Śikṣ 352.13, āsevaka (unmetr.! one ms. and
Śikṣ °kaṃ; WT with most mss. °kāṃ; Kashgar rec. °kā)
kṛsna tathādaditvā. Tib. acc. to Bendall rdul gzan, {%dust%}
{%garment%} (Jä. {%cloak%}, against dust on a journey), but acc.
to WT, and my own copy of Tib. SP, rṅul gzan, which =
{@saṃkakṣikā@}, q.v.; Burnouf and Kern {%woolen garment%};
note that Tib. rdul and rṅul are very easily confused in
writing; in MSV ii.52.5 āsevaka (ms., ed. em. āsīvaka)
seems to mean {%patch%} (so Tib., lhan thabs kyis klan pa);
in the next line, 6, sevakaṃ (ms., ed. em. sīv°) dattvā
dhāraya, seems to show the same mg., and in 11 below,
text āsīvakāṃs (by em.? ms. āsev° as before?) tu dattvā
dhārayitvayam, confirms this mg. (reference is to materials
unsuitable for making robes).
