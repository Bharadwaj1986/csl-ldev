{@vṛndi@}¦, or {@vṛndī@} (related to Skt. vṛnda, orig. {%swelling,%}
{%mass%}, as m. in Suśr. {%tumor%}; = Pali, AMg. bondi; see
Edgerton, JAOS 69.229, anticipated, as I learned too late,
by Lüders, KZ 52.106--9, with relevant materials not
included by me; cf. {@voṇṭa@}), {%body%} (orig. {%solid mass%} or the
like): vaḍḍā (see {@vaḍḍa@}) ca vṛndi (in this pāda mss. lack
3 syllables; perh. read ca vidyate vṛndi, or, ca vṛndī,
which in this position makes better meter than vṛndi,
bhavati) prajñā ca te na vidyate Mv ii.249.19 (vs), so
mss., {%you have a big body, but you have no wit%}; = Pali
Jāt. ii.160.11 mahatī vata te bondi na ca paññā tadūpikā.
Senart failed to note the parallel and emended the text
badly.
