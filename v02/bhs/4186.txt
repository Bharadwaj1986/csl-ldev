{@ojā@}¦ (= Pali id.; derived by Childers and Senart from
Skt. ūrj, by PTSD from ojas, which seems more plausible),
{%food%}: Mv i.210.19 = ii.14.20 (prose) (lābhinī bhavati
divyānāṃ gandhānāṃ…mālyānāṃ…vilepanānāṃ) di-
vyānāṃ ojānām; ii.131.3 (and 6) (prose) (vayaṃ te roma-
kūpa- [mss. °pe] vivarāntareṣu) divyām ojām adhyohari-
ṣyāmaḥ; see s.v. {@adhyoharati@} (used in Pali, like its noun
ajjhohāra, of food). It seems clear that in BHS, at least,
ojā means simply {%food%}, not {%essence%} or the like.
