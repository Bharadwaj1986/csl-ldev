{@śulkayati@}¦ (Skt. Dhātup.; denom. to śulka), {%taxes,%}
{%imposes a tax-duty%} (upon); in the first passage perhaps
{%pays a tax-duty%}: (yaḥ kascit paṇyam) aśulkayitvā gami-
ṣyati Divy 276.2, but this may mean {%whoever goes without%}
(the tax-collectors') {%having imposed the tax%}; so at least the
other passages suggest: śulkaśālikena sārthaḥ śulkitaḥ
276.18; (nūnaṃ sārtho na nipunaṃ) śulkito, bhūyaḥ
śulkayāma iti 21; (tair asau sārthaḥ punaḥ pratinivartya)
śulkitaḥ, nāsti kiṃcid (so punctuate) aśulkitam 22, {%was%}
{%assessed, and there was nothing%} (that had) {%not%} (been) {%taxed%}.
Alternatively, the mg. in all passages may be {%figures the%}
{%taxable value, assesses%}; such a term could be applied to
either the wares or their owners.
