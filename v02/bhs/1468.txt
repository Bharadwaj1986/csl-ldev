{@? abhigṛhṇati@}¦ (°āti; Pali abhigaṇhāti, {%overcomes%},
once, see CPD which suggests em. to adhi°), {%excels, sur-%}
{%passes%}: Mv ii.307.6, mss. abhigṛhṇanti (buddhā, raśmi-
bhiḥ), Senart em. ati° (but ati-grah- in this sense is rare
and doubtful in Skt. and does not occur in Pali); in next
line 7 Senart reads atigṛhyate with one ms., the other
reads abhigṛhniṣu; a pass. seems required but perhaps
abhigṛhyate is to be read.
