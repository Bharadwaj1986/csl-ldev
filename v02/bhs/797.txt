{@-anujñā@}¦, in {@lokānujñā@} Mv i.78.17, one of the 8
{@samudācāra@} (q.v., {@1@}) of Bodhisattvas in the 1st bhūmi.
Senart p. xxvii {%l'adieu au monde%}. But if I am right in
relating this list to the 10 bhūmipariśodhakā dharmāḥ of
Dbh p. 19 (sec. UU), see esp. lines 20-23, it must correspond
to lokajñatā, see Dbh 19.12--15; {%knowledge of%} (the varying
traits of) {%people%}. The Mv may even contain a corruption
of lokajñatā; equally bad corruptions occur often in its mss.
