{@vi(c)chandayati@}¦, for which forms of vi-chind- occur
[Page484-b+ 71]
in mss., cf. also {@vicchindika@} and prec.; see Wogihara,
Lex. (mss. vary in Bbh between a and i); in Pali (kāya-)-
vicchinda occurs as title of Jāt. 293, surely meaning
{%aversion from the body%}, not {%cutting off of…%}; in Pv. comm.
129.26 atidānato vicchinditukāmo clearly means {%wanting%}
{%to dissuade from over-generosity%}, = BHS vi-chand-; Pali
(kāya-)vicchandaniya(-kathā) and (kāya-)vicchandanika-
(-sutta) cannot be separated from (kāya-)vicchinda, above;
in Divy 590.24 even the v.l. vicchedayām āsuḥ occurs for
vicchandayām āsuḥ. It is clear that Pali and BHS both
show what must, therefore, be a very old confusion between
chand- and -chi(n)d- here. As Kern (cited PTSD s.v.
vicchinda), Wogihara, and some others have seen, the
orig. form was surely {@vicchandayati@}; the forms with
chi(n)d- are due to popular etym. (in some occurrences
the word means something close to {%cuts off%}). The funda-
mental mg. is {%makes undesirous%} (denom., vi plus chanda);
so Tib. mos pa zlog pa on Mvy, ḥdun pa zlog on KP,
both mg. {%desire-deterring, desire-dissuading%}, but on LV
simply zlog par byed pa, {%dissuasion-(deterring-)making%}:
°dayati Mvy 6527, foll. by vicakṣuḥ-karaṇāya; bhūyo-
bhūyaḥ sa māṃ °dayati, bhadramukhāniṣṭo 'sya karmaṇo
phalavipākaḥ Divy 10.6, similarly 11.24, {%dissuades%}; °dayām
āsuḥ (v.l. see above) 590.24; (Māraḥ…) bodhisattvaṃ
…evaṃ °dayiṣyati AsP 331.16, {%will (try to) dissuade%};
(iha…bodhisattvasya…pāpamitraṃ, yaḥ prajñāpāra-
mitāyāṃ) carantaṃ virecayati (q.v.) vichandayati ŚsP
1185.19, modulated in the sequel (the means of dissuasion
are given 1186.1 ff.; they consist of attacks on the dog-
matic interpretation of Buddhism accepted in this school);
(devaputrāḥ…Māraṃ…) vicchandayanti LV 333.20
and 335.10 (prose), {%dissuade, discourage Māra%} (by pre-
dicting his defeat); °dayati vikṣipati KP 1.6; when the
thing dissuaded from is expressed it is regularly abl.,
dānād vicchandayan Jm 24.7; (saṃgrahavastubhyo) vic-
chandya Śikṣ 50.12; adattādānād °dayati Gv 155.15;
vichandya (v.l. vichindya) with ablatives Bbh 16.2 ff.,
so also °dayet 27.12; °dayati (v.l. °chind°) 262.13; but
once apparently acc., (yasmāt tvaṃ bhikṣucaraṇapranā-
maṃ) māṃ °dayitum icchasi Divy 383.6, {%since you wish%}
{%to dissuade me%} (against, from) {%bowing at the feet of monks%}
(or is this acc. a Bhvr. adj., {%me characterized by bowing%}
etc. ?).
