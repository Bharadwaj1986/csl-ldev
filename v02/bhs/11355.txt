{@bhautika@}¦, (adj.?) subst. nt. (cf. Skt. id.; here in
specialized mgs.), ({@1@}) possibly adj., {%real%} or {%material%}, in
Laṅk 17.5, but the reading is very doubtful and the sense
at least equally so, see s.v. {@abhauti@} and below; ({@2@}) subst.
nt., {%object of sense%}: in Dharmas 40 = viṣaya or indriyārtha
(five are listed: rūpa, śabda, gandha, rasa, and sparśa,
corresponding, tho in different order, to the five mahā-
bhūtāni listed in 39 just before). Acc. to Suzuki's Index to
Laṅk, the Chin. versions of Laṅk indicate bhautika = {%the%}
[Page413-a+ 52]
{%4 viṣaya%} or {%color, odor, flavor, contact%} (note omission of
{%sound%}, and the fact that in Laṅk 124.8 ākāśa is added
only parenthetically; cf. the 4 dhātu of Pali, paṭhavī-,
āpo-, tejo-, vāyo-dhātu, Childers, s.v.); in Laṅk 205.10
(omit bhūta-with 2 mss.) bhautika-svalakṣaṇa-vināśānu-
palabdhir, evidently {%products of the bhūtāni%}, presumably
as in Dharmas 40. The passage Laṅk 123.11--124.16 must,
it seems, somehow be interpreted in the light of these
passages, but is obscure to me (cf. also Laṅk 355.1). Suzuki
is not very helpful on it; e.g. 124.13 na tu mahābhū-
tānām certainly cannot mean {%which%} (primary elements)
{%are non-existent%}, but rather: (the mahābhūtāni are the
causes of the bhautikāni), {%but not%} (the bhautikāni) {%of the%}
{%mahābhūtāni%}, i.e. {%but not vice versa%}. In Mvy 1847 bhau-
tika-rūpam appears to be parallel and complementary to
1846 {@upādāya-rūpam@}, q.v.; this suggests that bhautika-
rūpam = Pali bhūta-rūpa (Childers and PTSD s.v. rūpa),
which acc. to Vism. = the four mahābhūtāni, earth, water,
fire, and air (listed Mvy 1838--1841), contrary to Dharmas
and the Chin. as cited by Suzuki, above; for the viṣayas
are included among the 24 upādā(ya)-rūpa of Pali. On
the basis of Mvy 1846--7 we might conjecture that in Laṅk
17.5 (see {@abhauti@}) abhautika = upādāya(-rūpam), and
bhautika = bhautika (Pali bhūta)-rūpam. But if Dharmas
and Chin. are right, bhautika would mean virtually the
opposite of Pali bhūta(-rūpa).
