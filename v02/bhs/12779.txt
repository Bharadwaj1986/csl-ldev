{@rāśi@}¦, m., {%group, collection%}; ({@1@}) (= Pali rāsi) applied
to three {%groups%} or {%categories of%} (human) {%beings%}, called
mithyātva-(or mithyatva-)-niyata, samyaktva-ni°, and
aniyata, respectively (= Pali micchatta-niyata, sam-
matta-ni°, ani°); Childers, PTSD, and Senart Mv i.517
(on 175.13--16) all wrongly apply the term to {%views%} or
{%behavior%} instead of {%creatures%}. Very clear is LV 400.2: trīn
sattvarāśīn, ekaṃ mithyatvaniyatam, ekaṃ samyaktvani-
yatam, ekam aniyatam; it is then explained that the first
is {%fixed in falsity%}, permanently unable to know the doc-
trine; the second {%in truth%} (they will learn the doctrine
whether a Buddha preaches it to them or not); while
the third is {%undetermined%} (they will learn the doctrine if
they hear it preached, not otherwise); substantially the
same is said in Mv iii.318.5 (reading mithyātva°); in Mv
i.175.13--16 (vss), the {%group fixed in falsehood%} (mithyātva-
niyato rāśiḥ) will fill up the {%undetermined group%} (aniyataṃ
rāśiṃ) on Buddha's appearance, and the aniyato rāśiḥ will
fill up the rāśiṃ {@samyak@} (= samyaktva-niyataṃ rāśiṃ);
similarly Mv iii.347.4 ff.; saṃvarṇitaḥ samyaktvaniyato rāśir
vivarṇito mithyātva-ni° rāśiḥ parigṛhīto ({%embraced, brought%}
{%into the fold%}) 'niyata-rāśir LV 351.9; in Mv i.316.17 read
mithyatva-niyato rāśi(ṃ ? n. sg.) for corrupt mss. nityatva-;
[Page455-a+ 71]
samyaktva-niyata-rāśiḥ, mithyātva°, aniyata-r° Mvy 1737-
39; mithyātva° also Mvy 6830; sattva-rāśīnāṃ samyaktva-
niyata-tāṃ ca, mithyātva-niyatatāṃ ca, ubhayatvāni-
yatatāṃ ca yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti Dbh 76.1; the aniyata
and mithyātvaniyata rāśi do not exist in Sukhāvatī,
Sukh 44.15 f. (in 14 the people there are called niyatāḥ
samyaktve); the 3 rāśi listed (with spelling mithyatva-)
Hoernle MR 21.1 (from Saṃgīti Sūtra); ({@2@}) there are also
three rāśi, {%groups%}, of dharmas which are abhisaṃbuddha
by a Tathāgata: Bbh 404.23, defined 24 ff. as arthopasaṃ-
hitā dharmāḥ, anarthopasaṃhitāḥ, and naivārthopasaṃ-
hitā nānarthopasaṃhitāḥ.
