[{@hayana@}¦, assumed by Senart's em. with Skt. Lex.,
Amarakośa, id. (v.l. ḍayana), {%litter, palanquin%}, in Mv
i.109.1 (āryā vs) where mss. na-varehi, Senart hayana-va°,
but yāna-va° is simpler and quite as good in both meter
and sense; again in ii.171.10 (prose) Senart onaddha-
hayane, but mss. -puṇya, -puṇyaṃ; in the corresp. incident
in the Pali form of the same story, Jāt. iii.61.6, we find
paṭicchanna-yāne; -yāne is at least as close to the mss.
as Senart's -hayane, and might better be adopted.]
