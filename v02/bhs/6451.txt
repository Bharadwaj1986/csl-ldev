<L>6451<pc>237,1<k1>जतुयन्त्र<k2>जतु-यन्त्र
{@jatu-yantra@}¦, loc. °tre, lit. {%lac-machine%}, n. of some art,
in a list of those in which the Bodhisattva excelled; so
read in LV 156.22, for Lefm. jala-yantre; mss. vary, A
(the best) cited as janu- (read jatu-)y°; Calc. jatu°, con-
firmed by Tib. rgya skyegs kyi ḥkhrul ḥkhor, {%machine of%}
{%lac%}. The precise mg. is obscure to me; in corresponding
lists of arts I have found nothing similar, unless jantunā
Mv i.129.9 (in a corrupt and obscure line, included in a
passage of similar tenor) conceals jatunā, instr. of jatu.
