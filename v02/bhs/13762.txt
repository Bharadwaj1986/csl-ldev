{@vijñānāhāra@}¦, m. (= Pali viññā°), the fourth kind
of {%‘food’%} (see s.v. {@kavalīkārāhāra@}), acc. to PTSD con-
sisting of vijñāna as the {%food%} or {%material cause%} from which
rebirth arises: Mvy 2287. Dharmas 70 seems (corruptly)
to have {@dhyānāhāra@} instead. Cf. LaVallée-Poussin,
AbhidhK. iii.121, which however does not furnish a clear
definition.
