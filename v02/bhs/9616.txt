{@Purāṇa@}¦ (= Pali id.), n. of a sthapati of Prasenajit,
associate of {@Iṣiḍatta@}, Divy 77.27; 466.23, or {@Ṛṣidatta@},
spelled {@Riṣidatta@} in Av i.224.3, and {@Ṛddhidatta@} in mss.
Av ii.9.7. He, and perhaps his associate, were doubtless
referred to in MSV ii.70.4, which must contain a lacuna
as well as more than one corruption. See also next.
