<L>9650<pc>349,2<k1>पुष्णाति<k2>पुष्णाति
{@puṣṇāti@}¦ (Skt.) used in Laṅk in a curious way which
I find it hard to interpret; Suzuki omits the word in his
transl.: (people who fail to abandon false distinctions)
vikalpayanti ({%discriminate%}, sc. falsely) puṣṇanti (? {%develop%},
i.e. expand, in worldly activity; the opposite of praśama)
na praśamaṃ pratilabhante ({%do not attain tranquillity%})
Laṅk 21.2. Perhaps cetanāṃ, or a synonym, is to be
supplied as object; cf. MSV ii.79.9--10 cetanaṃ puṣṇāti,
{%develops%} or {%cherishes%} (the following) {%thought%}.
