({@chādayati@}¦, Skt., ({@1@}) {%covers%}: in Mv iii.55.4, text,
kuñjaraṃ pi so…ṣaṣṭihāyanaṃ balaśaktikāye chādita-
vyaṃ manyeya, yo me…ṣaḍ vābhijñā balaṃ (so mss.)
vaśībhāvaṃ chādayitavyaṃ manyeyā (the last part, from
yo…, repeated 6--7, 8, 9--10). For the first chāditavyaṃ,
Senart thinks a form of {@chaḍḍeti@} must be read; but the
Pali parallel SN ii.222.10 reads tālapattikāya chādetabbaṃ,
(an elephant) {%to be covered with a palm-leaf%}, which proves
chāditavyaṃ correct. Perhaps read before it (with the
Pali) tāla-pattrikāye; possibly, however, tala-śaktikāye
(closer to our mss.), {%with an upheld arm%} or {%hand%}, see s.v.
{@talaśaktikā. (2)@} {%protects, helps, saves%} (cf. pw s.v. 6, {%schützen%}):
in LV 168.8 (vs) read, kṛpakaruṇā janiyā atiraudre chāditu
so bho (so best ms. A; all other mss. and Calc. śobhe, which
[Page236-a+ 71]
is uninterpretable), (by you) {%taking pity and compassion%}
{%on your very cruel%} (foe), {%he, lo! was protected%} (helped). So
Tib. seems clearly to read; it ends, de ni ({%that very one%})
khyod kyis ({%by you%}) bskyabs ({%protect, help%}).
