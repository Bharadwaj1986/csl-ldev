{@triḥsahasrā@}¦ (only f.) = {@trisahasrā@}, see {@°ra@}; like the
latter only in vss, and °sah° presumably m.c. for °sāh°;
printed in LV 368.7 (°rā), 11 (°rā) and 21 (°rāṃ, here with
medinī = °nīṃ); all mss. in 7 and 21, and all but one
(A, the best) in 11, read tri-sah°, unmetr., Lefm. em. m.c.;
trī° would be equally satisfactory but A triḥ° in 11;
triḥs- can be interpreted as doubling of the sibilant m.c.,
but doubtless influence of tris, {%thrice%}, is involved. No
noun accompanies the (substantivized) adj. in 7, 11.
