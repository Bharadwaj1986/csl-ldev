{@punā@}¦, for punar, {%again%}, or rather {%but, yet%}, prob. m.c.
for MIndic puna: Gv 476.9 (vs: before ca). So also Pali
Jāt. iii.437.26 punā atthi (vs, m.c.). The form occurs in
Pkt., as uṇā or puṇā- (in comp.), where it seems not to
be m.c. and is regarded by Pischel 342 end, 343 end, as
abl. to the ‘stem’ (p)uṇa-; cf. under {@puni@}; or in the case
of puṇā-perhaps due to lengthening in the seam of cpds.,
Pischel 70.
