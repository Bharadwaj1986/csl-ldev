{@aparāntaka@}¦, f. {@°ikā@}, adj. {%of the western border, or of%}
{%the country called Aparānta%}; used of cloth or garments,
also as nt. noun, (cloth or garments) {%of Aparānta%} Mvy 9179;
°ka- in cpd. Divy 316.26, of garments (adj. or noun?).
In Divy 20.22-23 perhaps read aparāntikayā guptikayā
{%in the style of Aparānta%} (? see {@guptikā@}); text asmāt
parānti°. In Divy 1.3; 18.6; 19.16, 19, 23; 21.2, 12 the mss.
read corruptly, and with much variation, a text discussed
by the editors on p. 703; they read asmāt parāntaka-
and interpret as a synonym of {@pratyantima@}, except in
19.19 where they read asmākam aparāntaka-, interpreting
(with privative a-) as the opposite, {%not distant, near%}. The
forms are troublesome; without much confidence I suggest
that forms of aparāntaka may have been found in all,
meaning something like {%of the western border%} (if not speci-
fically {%of the country Aparānta%}). But Tib. (Bailey, JRAS
1950.172) on 19.19 points to {@Aśmāparāntaka@}, q.v.; and
this seems to have been the regular Tib. form acc. to
Schiefner, cited Divy p. 703.
