{@anokāśa@}¦, adj. Bhvr. (= Pali anokāsa; for {@an-ava-@}
{@kāśa@}), {%having no sufficient space, crowded%}: Mv i.175.12
°śā kṛtā svargā, {%the heavenly worlds are made crowded%} (by
Buddha's appearance, which leads many to heaven). Most
mss. read anākāśā, but there can be little doubt that
Senart's text is correct.
