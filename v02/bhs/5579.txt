{@gacchati@}¦, seems to be used in the sense of Skt.
tiṣṭhati, vartate, {%exists, carries on%}, or substantially this,
in Mv i.22.11 (gharakehi) oruddhā chinna-īryāpathā (mss.
oruddha chinna-ir°) gacchanti, (sinners in hell) {%shut up%}
{%in huts, get along with their freedom of action cut off%}. So
Senart's note. PTSD s.v. 5 gives a similar definition, but
the passages it cites obviously do not support it. Here
perhaps gacchanti Mv i.17.11, 12.
