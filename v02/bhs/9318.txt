{@? palīkṛta@}¦, in Av ii.136.10 (vs) ādīptaṃ kānanaṃ
sarvaṃ parvatā pi °kṛtā, perh. {%even the mountains are made%}
{%into straws%} (pala, Skt. Lex., {%straw%}). Speyer, {%a-glowing%}, with
little if any support, and evidently thinking the word
must have a mg. similar to ādīptaṃ; but this is quite
unnecessary; two entirely separate situations are referred
to, related only in that they are things hard to conceive
as accomplished. Speyer cites Tib. as ser bo, which he
identifies with ser po, {%yellow%}; this, even if justified, does
not give the meaning he assumes.
