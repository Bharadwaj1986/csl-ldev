{@paricārayati, °reti@}¦ (= Pali °reti, AMg. pariyārei;
Skt. °rayate, only BṛhU. 6.1.1 Mādhy., 6.2.1 Kāṇva, and
KaṭhaU. 1.25, defined BR {%sich bedienen…, aufwarten%}
{%lassen%}, but rather {%amuses oneself%}; cf. Charpentier IA
57(1928), note 96, on KaṭhaU. 1.25, where it means…
{%with women%}), ({@1@}) {%amuses oneself%}: very often preceded by
krīḍati ramati (°te), the latter sometimes omitted, as in
Mv ii.97.8; of any kind of amusement, as krīḍanakaiḥ
krīḍanti ramanti paricārayanti SP 72.13, and so (not of
sexual pleasures) SP 78.2; 80.1; 361.4; Mv i.194.17 (with
liquor; read with mss. paricāretsu, proved by corresp.
passage in Pali DN ii.172.5 paricāresuṃ); but esp. of
sexual enjoyment with women, krīḍāhi ramāhi paricārehi
Mv ii.103.6; similarly 443.8, 11; 444.10; 452.10; iii.36.6;
37.14; Divy 1.6; 24.14 and often; Av i.13.8 etc.; RP 42.7;
same trio of verbs but not clearly or exclusively of sexual
pleasures Mvy 7349 (cf. 7347--8); Suv 183.2; LV 157.7;
Mv i.32.6; 194.17 (mss.); Divy 3.25; Sukh 42.9; used alone,
without krīḍ- and ram-, in the specific sense of {%has sexual%}
{%intercourse%} (with, instr. with sārdhaṃ), Bhavena…tayā
sārdhaṃ paricāritaṃ Divy 25.28; tāḥ parapuruṣaiḥ sār-
dhaṃ paricārayanti 496.5; anayā parapuruṣeṇa sārdhaṃ
paricāritaṃ 538.1, and similarly 2; °yati MSV ii.36.3;
°yāvaḥ, dual, MSV i.213.16; ({@2@}) {%attends, waits upon%} (a
person; so simplex paricarati in Skt.): tena dāni pratye-
kabuddhena ye paricāritā (v.l. °vāritā) pratyekabuddhā(ḥ)
Mv iii.347.18; sarve pi devasaṃghā devīṃ (ii.20.7 Māyāṃ)
paricārayitva ākāśe Mv i.218.8 = ii.20.7 (vs), so Senart
in ii.20.7, in i.218.8 he reads °vārayitva (the mss. vary
between these two both times); note that acc. to PTSD,
Pali parivāreti is ‘often erroneously’ used for paricāreti;
similarly, paricaritā (so read m.c. for Lefm. paricārita,
v.l. °vārita) purime nara ye te sarvasukhenā LV 168.13
(vs), {%those men who formerly were attended%} (Tib. rim gro
byas, {%made homage%} or {%offerings%}) {%by you with every joy;%}
{%attends%} (a corpse, said of the funeral procession), pari-
cārayitva LV 190.16 (vs; no v.l.); ppp. {%attended, accom-%}
{%panied%} (of the mind), guṇagaṇa-paricārita-matī Mv
iii.104.16, {%his mind attended by flocks of good qualities;%}
{%frequented, occupied%} (of a place), nairayikehi sattvehi
śūlopetehi tāni parvatāni paricāritāni Mv i.6.14, {%these%}
{%mountains are frequented by hell-inhabitants impaled on%}
{%stakes%} (wrongly Senart's note); ({@3@}) possibly to be read for
paritārayanti Dbh.g. 44(70).11 in the mg. {%they get full%}
{%knowledge of%} (cf. pw 4.39 s.v. paritāraṇīya, where it is
suggested that paricār° be read, to be sure not in this
mg.); this is the regular Skt. mg. of {@pravicārayati@}, q.v.,
[Page322-b+ 71]
which occurs in this mg. in the preceding line 10, and which
in BHS is also used in the mg. of paricārayati (1), hence
perhaps the latter may have come to be used also in the
regular mg. of the former; but I have no parallel case;
({@4@}) {%summons%} (monks to a meeting): bhikṣūn paricārayitum
ārabdhaḥ MSV ii.175.9, so ms., ed. em. pracār°; Tib.
bsgrags pa, {%call%}.
