<L>14181<pc>499,1<k1>विवर<k2>विवर
{@vivara, (1)@}¦ nt., a fairly high number: Mvy 7853
(= Tib. yal yol), cited from Gv, which in 105.25 has
{@vivana@}, while Gv 133 omits the item; it corresponds to
{@vipatha@} of Mvy 7727; ({@2@}) m. or nt., a much higher number:
°raḥ Mvy 7782, °ram 7911, both = Tib. bsñad yas; the
latter cited from Gv but not found in either Gv list (106
or 133); ({@3@}) by corruption for viṃvara or {@bimbara@} (q.v.),
LV 147.22 (but this is cited from LV in Mvy 7958--9 as
viṃvara, and LV itself in 151.3 (vs) has bimbarāś); also
SP 409.6 (prose) has in text vivara, intending this same
unit as is shown by the preceding {@kaṅkara@}; vv.ll. of SP
quoted as viśvara, visvara, certainly intending viṃvara
or bimbara.
