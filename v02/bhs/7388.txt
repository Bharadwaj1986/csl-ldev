{@durāvagāha@}¦, adj. (for durava°), {%hard to fathom%}:
samudrakalpa…gambhīra-durāvagāhatvāt LV 424.11
(prose). See § 3.10. This is ignored by Weller 39, tho he
refers to two other cases of apparent vowel-lengthening
in the following lines (see l.c.). The -ā- here may have been
carried over from some passage in vs where it was metric-
ally required.
