{@Śākī@}¦, n. of a brahman woman, app. an ascetic, who
entertained the Bodhisattva: atha bodhisattvo yenaiva
Śākyā brāhmaṇyā āśramas tenopasaṃkrāmat; sā bodhi-
sattvaṃ vāsena bhaktena copanimantrayate sma LV 238.5
(prose); see Weller 29. But Tib. lacks the name: bram ze
rigs ldan (see below) kyi gnas, {%the dwelling of a person%}
{%of brahman family(?)%}. Note that immediately after this,
line 7, the Bodhisattva visits and is entertained by another
brahman woman, named {@Padmā@} (this time so named in
Tib.); the two statements are closely parallel. The Tib.
rigs ldan could mean {%noble%}, or represent a Skt. n. pr. such
as Kulikā.
