<L>2583<pc>089,1<k1>आघातिन्<k2>आघातिन्
{@āghātin@}¦, adj.-subst. (from āghāta {%slaying%} with -in),
{%murderous%} (person), {%murderer%}: LV 207.3 (vs) āghātina (so
read with all mss. but one which omits the syllable ti;
Lefm. em. °tana, wrongly) iva vadhyāḥ, {%like murderers%}
{%to be executed%}. In Ud ix.16 ms. aghātinaḥ could possibly
stand for āghātinaḥ, but more likely read aghāvinaḥ with
Chakravarti.
