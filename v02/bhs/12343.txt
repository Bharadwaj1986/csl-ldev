{@Maudgalyāyana, (1)@}¦ also {@Mahā-m°@}, = Pali Moggal-
lāna, gotra-name and usual appellation of {@Kolita@}, often
paired with {@Śāriputra@} as leading disciples of the Buddha:
story of his conversion, Mv iii.56.16 ff.; 57.18 etc.; the
forms without and with Mahā- often interchange in the
same passage and sometimes without significance, but
the Buddha himself always speaks of or to him as Maud°
(without Mahā-), e.g. in contexts where Mahā- is usually
prefixed, Divy 160.13, 17; 299.16 (but in 18 Ānanda
calls him Mahā-m°); Av ii.91.15; Aśoka refers to him
without Mahā-, but in a vs, Divy 395.20; other cases
without Mahā-, Mvy 1033; Divy 50.29 ff.; 182.22; 268.6;
314.15; 486.25; Av i.241.7 etc.; Sukh 31.3; Karmav 161.18;
et passim; ({@2@}) pl., n. of a brahmanical gotra: Divy 635.13;
cf. Maudgalyāyanīgotreṇa, of the nakṣatra Uttarāṣāḍha,
Divy 640.22.
