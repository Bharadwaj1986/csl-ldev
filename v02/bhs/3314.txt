{@Utkarika@}¦, n. of a merchant: Divy 227.26 tatrānya-
taraś cotkariko nāma baṇig…Cf. {@Otkarika@} (the same
person as Utk°). There seems to be no reason to connect
this n. pr. with aukarika (okkarika), qq.v., as has been
assumed by Feer, Speyer (on Av, Index, s.v. okkarika)
and Cowell and Neil (Index to Divy). But perhaps we
should read cautk° in 227.26 and assume Otk° as the name.
