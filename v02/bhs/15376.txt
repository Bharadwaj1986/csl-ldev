[{@ṣaṣṭhī@}¦, in Mv ii.21.2 (vs): (atra kiṃ kāraṇaṃ uktaṃ
yaṃ sapta kramate kramān,) na ca aṣṭa na ca ṣaṣṭhī
atra āgamanaṃ śṛṇu,…{%why he takes seven steps, and not%}
{%eight or…(?)%} Senart em. ṣaṣṭi, {%sixty%}, which seems to be
correct; see P. Mus, Barabudur 492, 480; Mv i.318.10
caṅkrama-ṣaṣṭiḥ, {%a promenade of sixty paces%}. The only
alternative, so far as I see, would be the unattractive
one of understanding the ordinal ṣaṣṭhī in the mg. of
the cardinal, {%six%}; the sense would, to be sure, then be
simple.]
