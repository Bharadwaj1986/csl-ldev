{@satyādhiṣṭhāna@}¦ (nt.; Pali saccādhiṭṭhāna, see below,
is not used in this way in MN iii.245.19; DN iii.229.18),
{%truthful resolve%}, viz. to apply {@satyavacana@}, q.v.: °naṃ
karomi, yena satyena satyavacanena svaṃ mama bāhum
…parityajya…(9) tena satyena satyavacanenāyaṃ
mama bāhur yathā paurāṇo bhavatv…(11) samanan-

{%taking one's stand on truth%}, but see the prec. words, s.v.

Mvy 1581 = Pali saccādhiṭṭhāna, rather {%resolve to adhere%}
{%to truth%}.
