{@lokākhyāna-kathā@}¦, Divy 304.27, and {@lokākhyā-@}
{@yikā@}, 26, 29, {%story-telling about the world%}. Here a work-
man tells entertaining stories to his fellow workmen.
Certainly not {%philosophical discussion about%} (the creation,
etc., of) {%the world%}, which is the scholastic interpretation
of Pali lokakkhāyikā (e.g. DN comm. i.90.32; MN comm.
iii.223.15), adopted in PTSD. I am not sure that this is
not late commentarial pedantry; in the canonical and
other early Pali texts, so far as I can see, the Pali word
might have the mg. which it clearly has in Divy.
