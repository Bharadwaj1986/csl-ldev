{@yan (yaṃ) nūna@}¦, (before aham) also {@nūnam@} but in
Mv {@nūnāhaṃ@}, rarely {@nūnaṃ@} (= Pali yan nūna, rarely
nūnaṃ; cf. prec.), {%suppose now%}, with 1 sg. opt. or (rarely)
indic.; acc. to PTSD, Pali yan nūna is or may be used
in the mg. {%suppose rather%}, suggesting an alternative to
some other course: once SP seems clearly to favor this;
after yan nu…nirgamayeyaṃ SP 73.2--3, {%suppose I cause%}
{%them to come out…%}, a tentative proposal, there follows:
yan nūnam aham etān saṃcodayeyam 73.5, {%suppose%}
{%rather…%}, with nūnam instead of nu; no other so clear
case, but {%rather%} may, at least possibly, be meant in yaṃ
nūna…SP 55.10 (vs), {%suppose%} (instead of entering nir-
vāṇa) {%that I%} (reveal the Buddha-bodhi); 196.7 (vs); LV
393.2 (vs); also in yan nūnāhaṃ Mv i.35.1; 37.7; 54.12;
343.6; ii.117.18; but the mg. {%suppose rather%} seems hardly
possible in yan nūnam aham…LV 258.21 (vs; verb here
samārabhe, could be opt. or 1 sg. ind. mid.); nor in most
of the following: yaṃ nūnaṃ Mv i.268.3; yan nūnāhaṃ
i.51.7 (prose; verb is tiṣṭhehaṃ, see § 31.21, v.l. °eyaṃ), 14
(verb is sthātum icchāmi, pres. ind.); ii.118.5, 11 (in 11,
if Senart's text is right, no verb! only dats. of nouns!
since adhigami and sākṣākari in 12 seems clearly aorists,
statements of fact, not dependent on yan nūnāhaṃ, which
is foll. by etasyaiva dharmasya prāptaye sākṣātkriyāyai;
which seems to complete the sentence); 124.9; with pres.
indic. verb ii.149.21 (here {%rather%} is perh. possible for yan
nūnāhaṃ). In Pali, besides opt., fut. indic. is recorded:
Childers 603, top of 2d column; cf. tiṣṭhehaṃ Mv i.51.7,
above.
