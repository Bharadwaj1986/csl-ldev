{@ayava@}¦, m. or nt., a high number, Mvy 7774 (m.; so
also Mironov); Gv 133.24 (nt.), cited in Mvy 7903 apparently
in mss. as apavaḥ, but Kyoto ed. in paren. adds (as em.?)
ayavam, and Tib. rendering is clearly meant to be identical
with that for ayava 7774. Altho Mironov reads apavaḥ
without v.l. in 7903, further confirmation of stem ayava
is prob. furnished by Gv 106.13 where for text sattvajava-
sya we should doubtless understand sattvāj°, that is
ajava = ayava (or even read sattvāyavasya?).
