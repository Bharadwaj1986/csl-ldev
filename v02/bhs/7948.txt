{@dhūmakālika@}¦ (Pali id., see below; from Pali °kāla,
{%death, destruction%}, Jāt. iii.422.14, plus -ika), {%subject to%}
{%destruction; destroyed, lost%}: (17--18 tīrthikā…krāyur, so
mss. for Senart kreyur, apratimaśāsana-doṣaṃ) dhūmakāli-
kam iti śramaṇasya, etad eva ca tu rakṣaṇīyatā (so with
most mss.) Mv i.69.19--20 (vs), {%the heretics may do harm%}
(or, {%cause enmity%}) {%to the matchless doctrine of the Monk%}
{%(Buddha), saying that%} (iti) {%it is perishable (is now going%}
{%to be destroyed); but this very thing is a state that we must%}
{%guard against%} (Senart quite differently, ignoring iti); saṃ-
gātavyam imaṃ vācyaṃ mā haiva (text °vaṃ) dhūmakā-
likaṃ Mmk 600.10 (vs), {%this text must be recited in unison,%}
{%lest it be destroyed (lost)%}; °ka-tā, abstr., (mā haiva prava-
canaṃ kṛtsnaṃ…) dhūmakālikatāṃ vrajet Mmk 596.25
(vs), {%lest the whole Gospel become destroyed (lost)%}. This, I
believe, is the mg. of the Pali word too; both the Pali
comm. and modern interpreters misunderstand it. In Vin.
ii.288.20 (bhavissanti vattāro:) dhūmakālikaṃ samaṇena
Gotamena sāvakānaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ, (if we
do not preserve the Gospel, {%people will say%}:) {%a perishable%}
{%set of religious teachings was taught by the monk G. to his%}
{%disciples%}, or in other words, these teachings are perishing,
or will perish. In Vin. ii.172.15, the only other passage
recorded, dhūmakālikaṃ pi pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ navakam-
maṃ denti, {%or they give as new work%} (the reparation of)
{%a completed monastery that has proved perishable%}, that has
[Page286-b+ 71]
fallen into ruin, or begun to. The adj. dhūmakālika cannot
mean, as is supposed, {%lasting to%} (the monk's) {%funeral%}, for
then it would be synonymous with yāvajīvikaṃ, just
before it, in line 15; the time expressions vīsativassikaṃ,
tiṃsavassikaṃ, yāvajīvikaṃ, lines 14--15, all forbidden,
contrast with lines 26--29 where jobs lasting from 5 or 6
to 10 or 12 years are permitted, but only upon an akataṃ
or a vippakataṃ vihāraṃ; it is these latter expressions,
in line 25, which contrast with the (forbidden) work on
a dhūmakālikaṃ pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ. It seems that this
derivative of (Pali) dhūmakāla came to be used figuratively
in a way fairly remote from its original and literal mg., like
English {%to go up in smoke = to be destroyed, completely lost%}.
