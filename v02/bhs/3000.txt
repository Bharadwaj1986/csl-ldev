{@Āvarta@}¦, m., n. of a sea and of a mountain: Divy
102.28; 103.23--104.20. Note: as common noun, āvarta
seems to me to have only meanings which it has in Skt.,
as {%turn, turning, turning-place%} (dhāraṇyāvartāṃ…dhā-
raṇīṃ SP 475.8 etc.); {%eddy, whirlpool%} (Mvy 7037); etc.;
in LV 126.7, several times, probably of {%turns%} (curves, or
the like) of alphabetic signs; see {@utkṣepa-lipi@}.
