{@adyāgre@}¦, Karmav 158.4 (much more commonly
adyāgreṇa, see s.v. {@-agreṇa@}), and {@adyād-agre@} Karmav
158.3, {%from now on%}: = Pali ajjatagge, ajjadagge (but not
°aggena!), derived by CPD from *ajjato agge, a theory
perhaps supported by adyād (abl.?) agre (but *adya-d-
agre, with hiatus-bridging d, see § 4.64, might have been
secondarily reinterpreted as adyād-).
