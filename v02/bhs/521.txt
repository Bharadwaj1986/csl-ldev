{@anagārikā; anagāriya@}¦, nt.; {@anāgāra@} (nt.); {@anā-@}
{@gārikā@} (= Pali anagāriya or anā°, generally nt.; anagāra
nt. only once, Sn 376, otherwise m. and personal, also
°rika, adj. and m. subst., personal; °rikā not in Pali),
{%homeless%} (ascetic) {%life%}. In most texts anagārikā (LV 18.8;
101.19; 103.20; Divy 17.17; 37.12; 141.1; Samādh 8.15,
etc.; rare in Mv, ii.69.1 with v.l. °riya), or anāgārikā (Av
i.136.6, so best ms., text ana°; i.234.1, no v.l.; Bbh 26.12;
°kāṃ pravrajyāṃ Bhīk 10b.1), are the regular forms, but
in Mv it is almost always anagāriya as in Pali; this has
not been noted elsewhere. Regularly in acc. sg. °rikāṃ,
°riyaṃ (only once anāgāraṃ [mss., Senart ana°] upetasya
Mv iii.387.1) depending on a form of pra-vraj (rarely of
abhi-niṣ-kram, Mv ii.161.5 ff.), and preceded by abl. (or
in Mv gen.) of agāra, {%retire from the home to the homeless%}
{%life%}. In this phrase the preceding form is always agārād
in all texts other than Mv, and sometimes there (ii.161.5 ff.;
iii.408.2); in Mv also agārato iii.378.4; agārāto iii.176.2;
agārebhyo i.128.10; read agārasmā, the Pali form, for
agārasthā i.104.8; but most commonly the gen. agārasya
i.322.15; 323.1; ii.117.18, 20; 140.3; 271.8; iii.50.11--12;
213.2--3.
