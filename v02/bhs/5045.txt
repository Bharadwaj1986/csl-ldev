{@kuśalapuṇya@}¦, {%meritorious deed of virtue%}, in Mv
i.81.1--2 contrasted with kuśalamūla, but whether the for-
mer marks a higher, more developed stage of religious
advancement than the latter (as Senart seems to believe),
is not clear to me: (ye punar…) bodhisattvā avaivartika-
tāyai pariṇāmenti, kin tu khalu teṣām upacita-kuśala-
puṇyānāṃ prathamā praṇidhir utpadyati, āho svid
upacita-kuśalamūlānām iti.The reply, in vss, first says
that worship of Buddhas etc. does not suffice. Then (81.16)
te yadā vipula-puṇya-saṃcayā, bhonti bhāvita-śarīra-
mānasāḥ; te…bodhaye upajanenti mānasaṃ; yaṃ mayā
kuśalamūlam arjitaṃ, tena me bhavatu sarvadarśitā;…
(82.3) yaś ca me kuśalamūla-saṃcayo, so mahā bhavatu
sarvaprāṇibhiḥ…Is puṇya of 81.16 something else than
kuśala-puṇya of 81.1--2? Both it and kuśala-mūla seem,
as far as I can tell, to have the same effect in the verses;
no clear answer to the question in the prose has been
discovered by me.
