{@pratipadā@}¦ = prec. (as in Pali paṭipadā), but very
much rarer; hence, where saṃdhi is ambiguous, I have
assigned the doubtful forms to {@pratipad:@} dharmadeśanā-
pratipadā-saṃpannaṃ…śāstāraṃ Mv iii.201.9, {%perfected%}
{%in the practice of preaching the law%}; ye sarvatragāminīprati-
padāṃ tatratatragāminīpratipadāṃ…prajānanti 320.14,
in list of the ten {@bala@} of a Tathāgata, see pratipad, towards
the end; nirvāṇagāminī °dā 201.15, 18; madhyamā °dā
331.8, 10, between the two extremes, introducing Four
Noble Truths; in 12 the word mārga is omitted, text
reading yad idam āryāṣṭāṅgikā, sayyathīdaṃ samyag-
dṛṣṭiḥ etc.; but one ms. reads āryāṣṭāṅgikaḥ, implying
mārgaḥ as in all known parallels, and the adaptation to
the fem. gender of pratipad in one ms. (followed by Senart)
is prob. an error, resulting from the accidental omission
of the noun mārgaḥ; below the usual formulas are found,
duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad-āryasatyaṃ 331.18; tatra
katamā (mss. °mo!) duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad
āryasatyā (! so mss. and Senart), eṣaiva āryāṣṭāṅgo mārgo,
etc., 332.9-10.
