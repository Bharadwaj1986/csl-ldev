{@kumāra-bhūta@}¦, adj., {%while still a youth; remaining%}
{%a youth%}; a stock epithet of {@Mañjuśrī@}, q.v., who is perenni-
ally young: SP 7.8--9; 260.16; 275.1 ff.; Mvy 650; but
also of others, esp. Bodhisattvas, Mvy 693--5, 698--9, and
cf. 883 te ca bodhisattvā…bhūyastvena sarve kumāra-
bhūtāḥ; also of Buddhas, with reference to the period
before their enlightenment, SP 19.2; 160.9; 311.2 (here of
Śākyamuni); and even of an ordinary human being,
Jīvaka, Divy 270.12, 20; 506.8 ff.; but this is probably
based on a misunderstanding and consequent re-formation
of next, q.v.
