<L>7735<pc>278,1<k1>धर्मचिन्ति<k2>धर्मचिन्ति(न्
{@Dharmacinti(n)@}¦, {%‘thinking on the Doctrine’%}, perhaps
n. of a previous incarnation of Śākyamuni (otherwise
unrecorded): LV 170.17 (vs). Tib. chos sems confirms the
meaning; but it lacks the connective daṅ, which occurs
after each of the other three names in the line; accordingly
it seems to have understood this word as an epithet of
the following Arcimān.
