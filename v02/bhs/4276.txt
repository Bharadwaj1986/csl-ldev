[{@audarika@}¦, adj., ‘2. {%dem Bauche zusagend’%}, pw, is to
be deleted; in the places there cited, LV (Lefm.) 264.15;
270.15, read {@audārika@}, {%material, substantial%} (of food),
with all mss.; Calc. auda°. In LV 407.22 (not cited in pw)
both edd. audarika without v.l., but certainly read audār°.
So also in Mv ii.131.1 and 8, read with mss. audārikam
āhāram (Senart em. audar°); the Pali parallel MN i.247.8 ff.
has oḷārika; so Mv ii.241.1, 3 (in 3 mss. app. °dar°); and
in Mv ii.277.18 read with mss. kāyo audāriko (Senart em.
audar°), of the Buddha's body.]
