{@khakharaka@}¦ (where gender is clear only m. noted;
= prec. and {@khakkhara@}), {%monk's staff%}: Mmk 42.26 (prose)
°ka-kamaṇḍalum, cf. daṇḍa-kamaṇḍalum 43.8; 91.15
(prose), in a list of monk's belongings, -cīvara-khakharaka-
śūcī (read sūcī)-; khakharaka-mudrā 418.11 and 422.4
(both prose); in 471.16 text tadaṅantare khakhavarakaḥ,
read khakharakaḥ (hypermetric even then!); 472.8 (vs)
khakharakaś ca mahāmudraḥ; in both the last khakharaḥ
(or khakkharaḥ) would be metr. better.
