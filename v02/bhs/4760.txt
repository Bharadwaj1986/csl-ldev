[{@kārīṣi?@}¦ form and mg. doubtful, in refrain pāda:
kārīṣi (so the mss. seem clearly to indicate; sometimes they
read °ṣu, and other vv.ll.) dattvā jinacetiyeṣu Mv ii.384.17,
repeated 21, 385.3, 7, 11, 19, 23. A parallel vs occurring
in the midst of these, 385.15, has (na) tailavinduṃ jina-
stūpe dattvā; and in a following vs 386.1 tailasya vinduṃ
jinacetiyeṣu occurs. This suggests that possibly tālīśa (°śu,
for °śaṃ?) should be read, = Pali tālīsa, tālissa, {%a ‘powder%}
{%or ointment’%} (PTSD) made from the plant named in Skt.
tālīśa; {@tālīśa@} occurs, perhaps in this mg. (associated with
tailam), in Mvy 5787, see s.v. It seems at any rate appro-
priate; some oily substance used in decorating a caitya is
indicated.]
