{@muṣṭi@}¦, f. (used in Skt. of the {%handle%} or {%grasping-%}
{%point%} of a weapon), {@(1) = muṣṭi-bandha@}, q.v., {%grip%}, a
manner of {%grasping%} (the bow): (bhagavatā, or maye,
mayā, spoken by the Buddha) cirapraṇaṣṭā Śāk(i)ya-
muṣṭi jñātā Mv ii.77.2, 3; 82.2, {%the long-lost%} (bow-){%grip of%}
{%the Śākyas was known%}; referring to the young Bodhi-
sattva's exploit of wielding the bow of his grandfather
Siṃhahanu, which no one else could wield; ({@2@}) see s.v.
{@ācārya-muṣṭi; (3)@} since {@rikta-muṣṭi@}, q.v., is used in
lists of things empty and delusive, the word muṣṭi alone
is, acc. to text Śikṣ 261.8, used in the same sense: evaṃ
cakṣuś cendriyaṃ ca rikte (app. dual) muṣṭisadṛśam (but
read rikta-muṣṭi-sadṛśam?) alīkam asadbhūtaṃ etc.; note
that after rikte the epithets are (at least mostly; but see
{@moṣadharma@}) singular, which makes the dual rikte
suspicious, despite the double subject; and the standard
use of {@riktamuṣṭi@}, occurring actually in the preceding
line of Śikṣ, makes the em. seem called for.
