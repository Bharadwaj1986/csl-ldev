{@adhyāśayati@}¦ (rare; doubtless denom. from {@adhyā-@}
{@śaya@}, q.v.; Pali only ppp. ajjhāsita {%intent upon%}, rare and
only in cpds.), {%is intent upon%}, with loc.: bodhisattvo
'dhyāśayaty anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau Śikṣ 17.21.
In LV 18.8 the good ms. A reads adhyāśayati for text
°sayati (mahāpṛthivīṃ…abhinirjityādhyāsayati), {%is firm-%}
{%ly fixed upon, occupies%}, with acc.; but probably text is
right; Skt. adhyāste is used in this sense, and the LV
form is only an aya extension of this; the meaning and
construction do not fit adhyāśayati.
