{@? svayaṃ@}¦, interpreted by Senart twice as prior mem-
ber of cpds. in mg. {%own%}, = Skt. sva(ka), adj., for which
saya, adj., is common in AMg.; I could hardly accept
Senart's interpretation except on the assumption that the
word is a form of that MIndic adj.; cf. conversely {@svakam@},
acc. to Senart = svayam. I can however not regard the
interpretation as certain. In Mv i.284.4 (prose), kumāro
brahmacārī svayam (perh. svaya-with m Hiatus-bridger?)-
āśrame (mss. °maṃ) paryaṅkena niṣaṇṇo, svayam could
be taken in its ordinary Skt. sense, {%(the youth) himself%},
rather than {%in his own hermitage%} with Senart. In i.302.6
(prose), Senart by em. svayaṃdhītā saṃveditā, {%he spoke%}
{%to his own daughter%}; if it means this, I should read svayā,
or (Skt.) svakā, or possibly svaya- (in comp.), dhītā; the
[Page616-a+ 71]
mss. read svajanaṃ dhītā saṃviditā; could this (taking
svajanaṃ as nom.) mean {%his people%} (and specifically) {%his%}
{%daughter was admonished?%} Undoubtedly his daughter alone
is actually addressed in the following, evaṃ tuvaṃ…;
and cf. svakā dhītā 304.8, in the verse version of the
story; on the whole the mg. assumed by Senart is prob.
to be accepted, but I question the form (= Skt. svayam).
