{@pāṇisvara@}¦ (m.? in Mv ii.52.15 seemingly nt.; = Pali
pāṇissara), prob. {%recitation%} or {%singing to the accompaniment%}
{%of clapping of the hands%}, a form of entertainment; PTSD,
a certain {%kind of musical instrument%}, but there seems to
be no evidence for this; on the contrary, pāṇissare (acc. pl.;
need not be personal, as PTSD assumes) in Jāt. vi.276.28
is expl. in comm. 277.1 by…ti pāṇippahārena gāyante;
doubtless persons performing the same activity, to (especi-
ally) waken in the morning and entertain a high personage,
are meant by paṭhanti pāṇisvanikāḥ Mbh. 7.2912 (Nīl.
hastena tālasvanaṃ kurvante, prob. {%palm-clapping%}, not
{%cymbal-sound%}; so pw s.v. tālasvana), also 12.1899 (no
comm. in Nīl.): pāṇisvaraṃ kumbhatūṇaṃ (see this)
mṛdaṅgānāṃ svarāṇi ca…pratibodhenti Mv ii.52.15
(= Jāt. v.390.25); pāṇisvarākhyāna- iii.122.17.
