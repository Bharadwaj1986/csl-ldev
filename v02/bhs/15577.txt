{@saṃgraha-vastu@}¦, nt. (= Pali saṃgahavatthu),
{%article of attraction%}, means by which a Buddha or (more
often in BHS) a Bodhisattva {%attracts%}, draws to himself
and to religious life, creatures. The literal mg. has been
much disputed; it seems to me clarified by LV 429.13
where reference is made to the Buddha's {%cleverness in%}
{%drawing-in creatures%} (sattvasaṃgrahakauśalyaṃ) {%by the net%}
(-jālena) {%of the 4 saṃgrahavastu%}; with this cf. Gv 495.20,
cited s.v. {@saṃgraha@}. As in Pali, there are four of these:
dāna, {@priya-vacana@} (or the like), {@artha-caryā@} (or
{@-kriyā@}), and {@samānārthatā@} (or {@samānasukhaduḥkhatā@}),
qq.v.; they are listed LV 38.16--17; 160.6--7; 182.6;
429.12--13; Mv i.3.11--12; ii.395.8--9 (without use of the
term saṃgraha-vastu); Mvy 924--928; Dharmas 19; Bbh
217.2--230.19, the inclusive term 227.5; 230.19; without
lists of the 4 items, SP 259.5; LV 35.9; 437.15; Mvy 793;
Divy 95.15; 264.29; Śikṣ 50.11; Av i.16.12; Gv 495.17
(in most of these the number {%four%} is specified). Sometimes
replaced by {@saṃgraha@}, q.v., alone.
