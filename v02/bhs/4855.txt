{@? kiṭika@}¦, m. or nt.: Divy 374.7 (prose) pañcastrīśatāni
kiṭikaiḥ saṃveṣṭya dagdhāni.(Burnouf, Intr. 365 note 1,
conjectures kāṣṭ[h]akaiḥ, implausibly.) Perhaps same
word as Pali kiṭaka, in Pv. i.9.2 and 4, something (acc.
to comm. [hot] {%copper plates%}) into which the {%clothing%} of
the petas is changed; thus it fits the Divy passage. There
is also a Pali kiṭika, Vin. ii.152.26 and 153.5, perhaps
also some sort of {%covering%}, but very obscure; comm. re-
peats it without glossing.
