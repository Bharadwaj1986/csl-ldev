{@śikhā-bandha@}¦, m., ({@1@}) (= Pali sikhā°, DN i.7.21),
a particular manner of {%doing up the hair%} ({%top-knot%}; in Pali,
acc. to DN comm. i.89.3 ff., with ornamentation): °dhaṃ
kṛtvā Mmk 38.19; ({@2@}) a particular technique of {%wielding%}
[Page528-a+ 71]
(the bow), presumably involving the {%top of the head%};
mentioned with {@muṣṭi-b°@} and {@pada-(pāda-)b°@} as an art
to be mastered by a prince: Mvy 4979; LV 156.12; Divy
442.7; Tib. on Mvy and LV thor tshugs (var. on Mvy
tsugs), which seems to fit mg. 1 above, meaning apparently
simply {%doing up the hair in a spiral%} (so Das) {%on top of the%}
{%head%}. This cannot be the mg. in these BHS passages, which
certainly refer to a manner of wielding the bow; see s.v.
muṣṭi-b°.
