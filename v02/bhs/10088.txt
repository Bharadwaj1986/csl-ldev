something, which usually precedes in comp.): prajñāpāra-
mitā-°ṇikaḥ Mvy 6687 (Mironov °ṇakaḥ); the gender of
the first element makes °ṇikā seem preferable, and this
is used in the same cpd. AsP 112.16 ff.; tasyāḥ (sc. prajnā-
pāramitāyāḥ) °ṇikām 113.3 (in the foll. passage it is said
to consist in the doctrine that impermanence, anityatā,
of the skandhas means destruction, vināśa, of them); na

{%counterfeit%} (of it); bodhisattva-prativarṇikaḥ 394.16, {%a%}

are parallels with pratirūpa(ka). (See Schmidt, Nachträge,
