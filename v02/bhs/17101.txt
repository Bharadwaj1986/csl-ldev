{@surati@}¦ (f.; cf. AMg. surai, surati; Skt. and Pali
surata), {%sexual enjoyment, lust%}: in Mv ii.63.4 (vs) read,
nearly with mss., vipuṇya-mānā suratī-(mss. cited as °bhi,
°bhir, a graphic corruption, cf. {@saurabhya@} for {@sauratya@})-
upadrutā, hirir nivāreti svacittam ātmano, {%Modesty re-%}
{%strains women of unvirtuous conceit (caprice, jealousy?)%}
{%who are afflicted with lust%}; the Jāt. parallel, v.410.13--20,
tho only loose, is close enough to show that the author is
speaking of Hrī restraining lustful women. Senart mis-
understands and em. wildly.
