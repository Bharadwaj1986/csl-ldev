{@mañjubhāṇin (1)@}¦ adj. (= Pali id.), {%sweetly prattling%}:
(of children) bālakā °ṇino Mv iii.84.18; ({@2@}) n. pr., = {@Mañ-@}
{@juśrī:@} Mmk 628.1 (vs); and prob. Mmk 434.16, where
text seems clearly corrupt, perhaps orig. a verse; text
has mañjubhāṇī immediately after bhagavāṃ (= Śākya-
muni), possibly then adj., {%sweetly speaking%}, but more likely
refers to Mañjuśrī who has just questioned the Buddha
(an acc. sg. form in original?). In Mmk 32.23 (vs) read.
prob. Mañjubhāṇī (text °bhāṣiṇī, unmetr.) tato bhāṣe
(refers to Mañjuśrī, cf. Mañjughoṣeṇa 18).
