{@dharma-paryāya@}¦, m. (Pali dhammapariyāya, not
well defined PTSD), lit. {%device, means of%} (teaching) {%the%}
{%doctrine%}, and so, secondarily, {%religious discourse%}. Cf. Pali
(kathā) sapariyāyā and nippariyāyā (e.g. Vism. 473.16--17),
{%discourse involving indirect- devices%} (not to be taken ab-
solutely literally), {%and discourse to be taken literally, without%}
{%‘devices’%}; cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. ix. 247, note. This fits the
regular BHS mg. of {@paryāya@}, q.v. 2. Tib. renders chos
kyi (dharma-) rnam graṅs, {%specification, enumeration%} (Das);
only in this cpd. the Tib. Dictt. allege also the mg. {%treatise,%}
{%dissertation%} for rnam graṅs, but obviously that is made
to fit this word alone; the Tib. rendering was intended to ren-
der Skt. paryāya, {%repetition, series%}, etc. (only in the Veda does
it mean {%a piece of text%}, and then chiefly if not exclusively
one that is {%repeated, a refrain%}, etc.; this special use cannot
be related to the BHS and Pali word, tho PTSD would
have it so). Originally, the mg. was close to that of {@upā-@}
{@yakauśalya@}, indeed it was a verbal manifestation of that
quality as clearly in: tathāgatasyaiṣa kulaputrā dharma-
paryāyo (so WT with most mss., supported by Tib. chos
kyi rnam graṅs te; KN deśanā-paryāyo, which would be
substantially equivalent) yad evaṃ vyāharati, nāsty atra
tathāgatasya mṛṣāvādaḥ SP 320.5, {%this is the Tathāgata's%}
{%way of%} (teaching the) {%doctrine…%} (sc. by giving out state-
ments not literally true); {%in so doing the T. does not lie%};
cf. dharmāṇāṃ paryāya-jñānam Bbh 214.10 (with dhar-
māṇāṃ lakṣaṇa-jñānam id.11); ayaṃ mañjuśrīḥ dharma-
paryāyaḥ, asmiṃ sthāne pracariṣyati Mmk 657.3, {%this, M.,%}
{%is a way of%} (teaching) {%the doctrine%} (does this refer to the
following discourse?); (ātmanaḥ parinirvāṇaṃ vyāharati
tathā tathā ca sattvān paritoṣayati) nānāvidhair dharma-
paryāyaiḥ SP 318.1, here perhaps merely {%by various ways%}
{%of%} (teaching) {%the doctrine%} (but possibly {%religious disqui-%}
{%sitions%}); more commonly the word comes to be used of
a specific {%religious discourse%}: asmin khalu dharmaparyāye

°ryāyaḥ RP 59.20 (similarly in Pali, DN i.46.20--21,
Ānanda asks, and is told, what is the name of this dham-

the simple {@paryāya@}, q.v., is used for dharma-p° in this
sense.
