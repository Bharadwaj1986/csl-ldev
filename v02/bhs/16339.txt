{@saṃmataka@}¦, adj., f. {@°ikā@} (Skt. saṃmata with -ka,
prob. specifying), {%(one that has been) agreed upon%}: MSV
i.235.5 (kalpika-śālā…) °tikā (sc. by the community of
monks). The context is that of Pali Vin. i.240.3, where
this word in acc. sg. is represented by sammutin (ti);
cf. SBE 17.121 (the note 1 on p. 120 is wrong as to ussāvana,
which = ussāpana; MSV i.235.4 ucchrīyamāṇāntikā,
{%whose confines%} [anta-ka] {%are being erected%}).
