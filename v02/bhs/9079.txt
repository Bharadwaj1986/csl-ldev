{@paripūrayati, °te@}¦; once {@°pūrati@}, once {@°pūryati?@}
(= Pali paripūreti, used similarly to mg. 1; not, seemingly,
in these mgs. in Skt.), ({@1@}) {%accomplishes fully, completes,%}
{%perfects, fulfils%} (cf. next): daśamāṃ bhūmiṃ °rayitvā Mv
i.142.3; Bhadracariṃ (17) or bodhicariṃ (22) paripūraya-
māṇaḥ Bhad 17, 22; sarvākāraṃ ({%every form%}, of Tathāgatas)
°rayiṣyāmaḥ Sukh 10.1; ṣaṭpāramitāḥ °rayati Kv 68.19;
82.9; -pāramitā °rayitavyā Kv 50.17, 19; sarvatyāgā-
dhimuktiṃ paripūrye (tyāga-) Śikṣ 34.1 (prose), read some
3 sg. opt. form, °ryet ? °rayet? °ret (cf. under 2) ?; ({@2@})
peculiarly used in Mv iii.356.6 (vs), so bhinnayānapātro
({%his ship being wrecked%}) paripūrati (v.l. °rayati, but meter
seems to support °rati) sāgaraṃ (so mss.) narapravaro (so
Senart em. for unmetr. ms. naravaro), which seems to
mean {%the noble man ‘filled the sea’%}, i.e. gave his life up
to it (for the benefit of his companions); this is what the
story certainly attributes to him. I have no exact parallel
to this usage but can conceive no other interpretation;
Senart's is very unsatisfactory (and involves the most
implausible em. sāgare).
