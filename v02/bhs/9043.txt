{@paridrava@}¦ (m.? = Pali pariddava, to which it is
prob. a hyper-Sktism; etym. of the Pali word obscure,
see PTSD for Trenckner's not very attractive theory),
{%lamentation%}: saha-śoka-paridravaṃ ca Dbh.g. 11(347).3,
so all Susa's mss.; text em. °pardevanaṃ (!), as if for
parid°; this is not only formally monstrous but metrically
impossible.
