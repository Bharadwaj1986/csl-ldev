{@? abhrati@}¦ (Skt. Dhātup. only, with artificial occur-
rences in Bhaṭṭikāvya; Pali abbhati, also only Gr.), {%goes%}:
perhaps read (a)bhritvā, or MIndic (a)bbhitvā, ger.,
[Page062-b+ 71]
{%having gone%}, Mv i.187.7 (vs; after final -o, -ā, or -e); mss.
bhyatvā or bhyotvā (one tyotvā, one datvā); Senart em.
bhūtvā, which I think is clearly wrong; a verb of motion
seems required.
