{@utkumbhati@}¦, prob. {%rears%} (of a balky horse; so guessed
from context): KP 108.2 (yatra…) aśva(ḥ) skhalati
utkumbhati vā khaḍunka- (q.v.)-kriyā vā karoti, {%when a%}
{%horse stumbles or rears or acts viciously%}. Tib. seems to have
no correspondent for this word; the several Chin. versions,
likewise, fail to clarify it; they seem to have only two
verbal expressions for three of the BHS.
