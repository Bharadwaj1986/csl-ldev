{@yathāvādi-tathākāri(n)@}¦, adj. and {@°ri-tā, °tva@}, subst.
(also as two separate adj., yathāvādī tathākārī Mvy 2408;
so clearly in Pali, the two separated by other words, DN
ii.224.3; Itiv. 122.2 ff.; in Sn 357 yathāvādī (v.l. °di-)
tathākārī, possibly as single cpd.), {%acting as one speaks,%}
{%according to one's word%}: °kāry-avitatha-vāk-karma-samudā-
hārakasya LV 8.7; yathāvādī-(! prob. read °di-)-tathākāri-
cittaṃ Gv 367.13 (prose); abstract nouns in -tā, -tva,
yathāvādi-tathākāri-tāṃ (acc.) LV 440.3; RP 8.11; °ri-tayā
(instr.) RP 10.7; Dbh 14.1; °ri-tvena Śikṣ 22.16; yathā-
vāditā-tathākāritā (read as one word) ŚsP 1460.11; in
Mv occur, in the mss., forms ending in °taṃ for both
members (kept by Senart for the second member, while
he em. the first to °ta-), also with reversed order of the two
parts (as in Pali ll.cc. above): yathākāritaṃ tathāvāditam
anuprāpnuvanti (one ms. adds, yathāvāditaṃ tathākāri-
taṃ anuprāp°, so surely read) Mv ii.260.13--14; in 261.15
both mss. invert the order, yathāvāditaṃ tathāk° anu°,
yathāk° tathāv° anu°. If the ending °taṃ is textually
sound, it can only represent °tām with MIndic shortening
of the vowel; perh. it should be em. to °tāṃ or °tvaṃ.
