{@jalpa@}¦, m., or better {@jalpā@} (= Pali jappā, {%desire%}),
{%desire%}: in Mv iii.284.19 (vs) mss. sarvāṃ prahāya bhavalo-
bhajalpaṃ, not to be emended; same vs in Pali SN i.123.8
chetvāna (v.l. hitvāna) sabbaṃ bhavalobhajappaṃ. It is
tempting to interpret in the same way such passages as
Laṅk 186.8, 9 (vss) jalpaprapañcābhiratā hi bālās…
jalpo hi traidhātukaduḥkhayonis, {%fools delight in jalpa and%}
{%idle fancies%} (? see {@prapañca@})…{%for jalpa is the source of%}
{%the misery of the universe%}. This seems more naturally to
mean {%desire%} than (idle) {%talk%}; but acc. to Suzuki's Index
Tib. (smra ba) supports the latter; this might however
only mean that Tib. knew the regular Skt. jalpa and had
lost the tradition of the old word represented by Pali
jappā.
