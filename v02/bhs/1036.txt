{@anuśaya@}¦, m. (= Pali anusaya; see pw s.v. for rare
Skt. occurrences with similar mg.; essentially a Buddhist
word), {%propensity%} (usually to evil), (innate) {%proclivity%}
(inherited from former births), {%disposition%} (to do something,
usually evil); the whole of ch. v. of AbhidhK (La Vallée
Poussin vol. 4, p. 1--118) deals with them; they are iden-
tified or associated with {@kleśa, paryavasthāna@}, and
{@āsrava@}, and they are the ‘root’ of bhava, renewed or
continued existence, l. c. p. 1. They number 7 in Pali:
(kāma-)rāga, paṭigha, diṭṭhi, vicikicchā, māna, bhavarāga,
avijjā (CPD); and in BHS 7 or (the two rāgas being taken
together) 6: (kāma-)rāga, pratigha, (bhavarāga), māna,
avidyā, dṛṣṭi, vicikitsā or vimati (l. c. 2, 3); or (ibid. 9),
dividing dṛṣṭi in five, ten anuśaya; or (ibidem) by further
classification, 98 (acc. to Yogācāras, ib. 21 n. 1, 128); on
the 98 cf. Sūtrāl. xiv. 46, Lévi's note; LV 372.13. Clearly
of evil {%propensities%} LV 351.8 (udghāṭitā) anuśayā(ḥ); 363.4
purimam (from former births) anuśayaṃ; 371.16, read
sānuśaya-mūlajālā with v.l. for text °jātā; 373.9 mūlakle-
śāḥ sānuśayāḥ; 373.17 anuśaya-paṭalā(ḥ) {%masses of anu-%}
{%śaya%}, compared to clouds; Gv 387.4 bandhanānuśaya-
paryavasthāna-vaśagatāḥ; Mvy 862 nānādṛṣṭy-anuśaya-;
2136 (follows bandhanam); Laṅk 140.7; Divy 210.5; 314.21;
Śikṣ 19.18 tṛṣṇānuśayaḥ; 50.9; 232.12; Bbh 202.20; 388.8;
Dbh 75.7 so 'nuśayānām āśaya-sahaja-citta-sahaja-tāṃ
ca yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti, {%the fact that the anu° are born%}
{%with intention and thought%}, and see ff. (75.7--13); in Pali
āsaya and anusaya, {%disposition%} (or {%intention%}, {@āśaya@}) {%and%}
{%propensity%}, are often mentioned together as parallels, and
are compounded; so BHS āśayānuśaya, Divy 46.23; 47.9;
48.12; 49.11; 209.12 etc.; Av i.64.12 etc.; in these the cpd.
usually refers to the mental condition of persons ripe for
conversion; Speyer, Index to Av, renders {%inclination of the%}
{%heart%}, as if a tatpuruṣa, but this seems clearly wrong; it
is a dvandva. In Av i.169.14 āśayānuśayam is parallel
with, and follows, {@nidānam@} (q.v. 2).
