{@utkrośa@}¦, m. (to ut-kruś; nowhere recorded except
as n. of a bird), {%outcry%}: LV 230.5 (vs) utkrosu (n. sg.)
mukto, and 8 utkrosu (acc. sg.) kṛtvā aho mama eka-
putro!; 232.20 (vs) utkrosu (mss. utkrāsu, utkāsu) kṛtvā
dharaṇitale nirasto; Gv 326.6 mahāntam ārtasvaram
utkrośam akārṣuḥ. Uncertain is Divy 453.21 (in a list of
five individuals who sleep little at night) utkrośa (v.l.
utkoṇa) ṛṇī; possibly {%a debtor in case of an outcry%} (made
against him by his creditor? understanding utkrośe). But
Tib., as translated in the note p. 709, is said to render
utkrośaḥ {%the red duck%} (see below; in Skt. a bird, {%Seeadler%}),
and seems to omit ṛṇī; probably read for this prāṇī (below).
Divy Index {%watchman(?)%}; implausible; PTSD compares
this word with Pali ukkusa, a bird, apparently {%osprey%}
(= kurara). Lacuna in this story MSV i.149.10; N. Dutt,
on basis of Tib. srog chags ({%living being%}) ṅur pa ({%red duck%}),
conjectures utkruśa-prāṇī. Should not Tib. be corrected
to ṅu ba, {%weep(ing)%}, = ut-kruś-?
