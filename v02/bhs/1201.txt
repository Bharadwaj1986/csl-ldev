{@anyatra@}¦, adv., ({@1@}) {%on the contrary%} (this mg. seems
exclusively peculiar to BHS); always after negative ex-
pressions: SP 73.10 anyatra tena tenaiva dhāvanti, (they
pay no attention and do not understand;) {%on the contrary,%}
{%they run this way and that%}; 102.9 na kasyacid ācakṣed
anyatraika evātmanādhyātmaṃ saṃtapyed, {%he would not%}
{%speak of it to anyone; on the contrary, he would all alone%}
{%be grieving himself by himself%}; 284.9; 378.4; LV 71.6
(Māyā felt no heaviness of body, gurukāyatāṃ;) anyatra
laghutām eva, {%on the contrary, nothing but lightness%}; 259.16;
260.8; 268.15; Mv iii.66.8 and 15 (there is no soul nor
anything resembling a soul;) atha evaṃ anyatra karma
caiva karmavipākaṃ ca hetuś (first time, hetuṃ) caiva
hetusamutpannā ca dharmā(ḥ), {%but rather, on the contrary,%}
{%only action%} etc. (see under {@atha@}); Laṅk 9.7 (see s.v. {@vikalpa@};
wrongly Suzuki); 39.7 anyatra kāraṇataḥ, {%on the contrary,%}
{%from a cause%} (wrongly Suzuki); 119.6 (place daṇḍa be-
tween evam and anyatra); 152.1; RP 42.4; Samādh 22.39
[Page041-b+ 71]
(wrongly Régamey); Śikṣ 147.3 (and several times in
Śikṣ followed by {@yāvad eva@}, {%just simply%}, q.v.); the negative
may be repeated just before anyatra, but only as resuming
the neg. of the preceding clause, not negating the clause
containing anyatra: Bbh 121. (19-)21 (a Bodhisattva does
not give a petitioner the trouble of asking repeatedly
before he gives him a gift;) nānyatra yācitamātra eva,
{%no; on the contrary%}, (he gives) {%the very moment he is asked%};
({@2@}) {%except%}; in Skt. and Pali hardly used except as pre-
position (with abl. in Skt., Pali aññatra also with instr.
and gen.); in Skt. very rarely as adverb, the noun being
construed with other words in the sentence (see BR 1.266
and pw 3.251). In BHS I have noted a single case, not
wholly certain, of anyatra as preposition with instr. (as
in Pali, instead of abl. as in Skt.): RP 40.4 rātriṃdivaṃ
bhavantībhir nānyā kathā kāryā, anyatra nṛttagītavād-
itena, {%you are to say nothing else, except dance, song, and%}
{%instrumental music%} (?). But the adverbial use in this mg.,
so rare in Skt. and not recorded for Pali, is well established
in BHS; in the following cases the form and construction
of other words in the clause is totally unaffected by
anyatra; often it may be translated as if it were a con-
junction, {%except that…%} It almost always follows a negative
expression (or interrogative, rhetorically equivalent to
neg.); and this is sometimes resumed by an additional
na before anyatra (as in the last case under 1, above):
Divy 6.28 sārthaṃ na paśyati nānyatra gardabhayānam
eva, {%he didn't see the caravan, not except only a donkey-%}
{%cart%}; and with anyatra as quasi-conjunction, Mv ii.90.14-15
nāsti anyo upāyo nānyatra etaṃ samudraṃ utsicāmi,
{%there is no other means, not%} (any) {%except%} (that) {%I bale out%}
(exhaust) {%this sea%}. In the next the na before anyatra goes
with the main verb (or rather ppp.): SP 318.4 nānyatra
sattvānāṃ paripācanārtham avatāraṇārtham ete dharma-
paryāyā bhāṣitāḥ, {%these dharmaparyāya are not spoken%}
{%except%} (i.e. are spoken only) {%to mature creatures and make%}
{%them arrive at comprehension%}. Otherwise, after negs.: LV
149.1 (nānyaḥ…saṃvidyate ya etāṃ gaṇanāṃ prajānāty)
anyatrāhaṃ vā yo vā syān mādṛśaḥ, {%except%} (it be) {%I or%}
{%someone like me%}; SP 276.6-7 na ca taiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃ-
stavaṃ karoty anyatropasaṃkrāntānāṃ…dharmaṃ
bhāṣate, {%and he has no association with them, except that…%}
{%he preaches the Law to them when they come to him%}; similarly
276.9--10; 324.8 yūyaṃ ca śabdaṃ na śṛṇotha mahyaṃ,
anyatra so nirvṛtu lokanāthaḥ, {%and you do%} (would) {%not%}
{%listen to my words, except%} (i.e. {%unless%}; sc. you believed
that) {%the Lord of the World has entered nirvāṇa%}; Sukh
42.(10--)11 (na ca…nānātvam asty) anyatra…saṃ-
khyāṃ gacchanti, {%except that…%}; Laṅk 19.8 (a passage
badly misunderstood by Suzuki; e.g. in 7 read 'dharmā =
adharmāḥ) na lakṣaṇataḥ kalpyāḥ (delete daṇḍa) te
'nyatra saṃvyavahārārthā abhidhīyante, {%they%} (impos-
sibilities like the son of a barren woman) {%are not conceiv-%}
{%able by way of characteristic marks, except that%} (? or possibly
{%on the contrary%}, to 1) {%they are spoken of as terms of common%}
{%use%} (they have existence only as words); Laṅk 20.1 anyatra
…vibhāvyate, {%except that it is discussed…%} (after neg.);
after interrog., Av ii.121.4 kānyā putrasya gatir anyatra
mātāpitarāv eva, {%what other recourse could there be for a%}
{%son%} (i.e. there could be none), {%except his parents%}; no
negative (except by vague implication), Divy 293. (15-)16
(annādyaṃ parikṣīṇam) anyatra…ekā mānikā…ava-
śiṣṭā, (edible things were destroyed, i.e. there were none),
{%except that…one m. was left%}; Gv 206.5 (see s.v. {@upād-@}
{@āya@} 1 d).
