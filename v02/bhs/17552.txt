{@svarasvara@}¦ (m. ? prob. āmreḍita of Skt. svara, cf.
{@svarāsvara@}; also {@sarasarāyate@} and Pali, AMg. sarasara,
to which this could perh. be a hyper-Sktism, influenced
by svara), {%varied sound, noise of various sorts%}: (a con-
demned criminal is led to execution) -kaṇṭheguṇena (so
mss., see this) svarasvareṇa paṭahena vādyamānena Mv
ii.168.9 (One might be tempted to take the form as an
adj. with paṭaha, {%rattling noisily%}; but such a use of svara,
or a MIndic equivalent, would seem to be unprecedented.)
