{@lokāntarikā@}¦, subst. f., usually pl. (= Pali lokan-
[Page464-b+ 71]
tarikā, subst., not adj., ‘scil. Niraya’, with PTSD), {%inter-%}
{%stice(s) between the worlds%}; they are dark, gloomy places,
a kind of purgatories: chiefly in a well-known cliché,
recorded SP 163.8; LV 51.10; 410.13 (and the first part,
ending andhakārās, as abbreviation, 351.22--352.1); Mv
i.41.4; 229.20; 240.9; ii.162.9; iii.334.7; 341.12; Divy
204.22; 205.4, 13, 23; 206.5, 16; Samādh page 7 line 9;
ŚsP 102.17 (abbreviated); and in Pali, DN ii.12.10; MN
iii.120.9; AN ii.130.24; SN v.454.16. There are minor
variants thruout, not all reported here, and in Mv the
mss. are mostly quite corrupt and vary widely; Senart
em. rashly; I shall quote a blended version which seems
at least close to a common Mv text. For convenience the
passage is divided into sections, (a) to (g); Divy lacks (b)
and (f); ŚsP lacks (a) and (g); in Samādh, (b) is lacking,
(a) and (c) come after (f); in Mv (all six passages) and
in ŚsP, (b) comes after (c): (a) om. ŚsP; yā (a)pi tā (Divy
adds lokasya; 204.22 lacks api tā, and so also SP; 3 of
6 Mv passages add loke) lokāntarikā (Pali lokant°); (b)
omitted in Divy, Samādh, and prob. corrupt in all; I
believe orig. had aghā aghasaṃvṛtā (Pali aghā asaṃvutā,
for which Senart, Mv i.406, brilliantly conjectured aghā
aghasaṃvutā; the Pali comms. seem to me fatuous, and
I cannot feel attracted by CPD's interpretation of aghā,
see s.v. {@agha@}; Mv supports Senart, and so in a measure
do SP, LV and ŚsP); the Mv tradition seems to point to
aghā aghasaṃbhūtapūrvā, in which with Senart I regard
saṃbhūta as a corruption for saṃvṛta, or MIndic saṃ-
vuta; close in sense, also, is aghā aghasphuṭā ({%full of%}
{%misery%}), the reading of LV and ŚsP (in ŚsP after c);
finally, SP, tho substituting (tāsu ya) akṣaṇāḥ for the first
aghā, and omitting the 2d agha-, actually preserves saṃ-
vṛtā(ḥ), alone among BHS texts (note that it has no
negative! thus tending to show the corruption of the
Pali); (c) andhakārā andhakāratamisrā(ḥ) (Pali andhakārā
andhakāratimisā); so Samādh; SP ed. omits andhakārā
(haplogr.), but v.l. has it; either it or andhakāra- is
omitted in ŚsP and both LV versions (haplogr.); Divy
andhās tamaso 'ndhakāratamisrā; Mv (very confused)
seems orig. to have read, andhakārā andhakārāpitatvā
(or °rāyitatvā) tamisrā (or ti°) tamisrāyitatvā (or ti°);
(d) yatremāu (yatra ime, etc.) candrasūryā(v; or variants)
evaṃ maharddhikā(v) (sometimes omitted) evaṃ mahānu-
bhāvā(v); SP, LV, ŚsP, Samādh add other adjectives prec.
by evaṃ; Pali yattha p'ime candimasuriyā evaṃ mahid-
dhikā evaṃ mahānubhāvā; (e) ābhayā (or ābhāya, etc.,
Mv; Pali ābhāya) ābhāṃ (or ābhāsaṃ; om. Pali) nānu-
bhavanti (so prob. orig.; LV om. nānu°; Pali nānubhonti,
but SP nānubhavataḥ, Divy na pratyanubhavataḥ, ŚsP
and Samādh na bhāsato, omitting ābhayā ābhāṃ before
it; Mv clearly intends nābhisaṃbhuṇanti, all 6 times;
Pali comm. on DN, ii.433.23, attano pabhāya na-ppahonti,
on which the ‘old ṭīkā’ cited CPD glosses…obhāsituṃ
an-abhisaṃbhuṇanti, cf. Mv!); (f) ? not in Pali or Divy, perh.
not orig.; SP varṇenāpi varṇaṃ tejasāpi tejo nānubhava-
taḥ; LV varṇena varṇaṃ tejasā tejo nābhitapato nābhiviro-
cataḥ (best mss. nāti° for nābhi° both times); ŚsP, Samādh,
na tapato na virocataḥ; Mv ālokena vā ālokaṃ na spha-
ranti; (g) uncertain; not in ŚsP; Pali tattha pi appamāṇo
uḷāro obhāso pātubhavati; SP, LV (in LV after insertion)
tatrāpi (SP tāsv api) tasmin samaye mahata udārasyāva-
bhāsasya (SP mahato 'vabhāsasya) prādurbhāvo 'bhūt;
Divy tā api tasmin samaye udāreṇāvabhāsena sphuṭā
bhavanti; Samādh tā api tasmin samaye tenāvabhāsena
sphuṭā abhūvan; Mv te (once tā) pi tena obhāsena sphuṭā
abhūnsuḥ, with varr. The entire cliché means approx-
imately: {%And even those world-interstitial-spaces%}, (which
are) {%miseries and covered over with miseries, darknesses,%}
{%glooms of darkness, --in which the moon and sun here,%}
{%which possess such great supernatural power and dignity%}
(or {%capacity%}), {%are not capable of%} (producing) {%light by%} (their)
[Page465-a+ 71]
{%light,…%} (f varies too much to admit a unified rendering,)
{%even in them a great, magnificent radiance appeared (at%}
{%that time)%}.--Besides this cliché, lokāntarikā occurs in,
na ca vedayanti duḥkhaṃ °rikā vipadyamānā (? em.) Mv
ii.34.16; alone, Mvy 3062; lokadhātor °rikā duratikramā
Dbh 58.11; sarva-°rikāś ca tasmin samaye mahatāva-
bhāsena sphuṭā abhūvan LV 86.19 (cf. the cliché, g);
(na ca bhūyo) °rikā…prajñāyante sma LV 277.9.
