{@? dhātu-rāṣṭra@}¦, in °ṭropaśobhitāḥ Sukh 39.3, epithet
of the rivers of Sukhāvatī; Müller, SBE 49.2, p. 39, {%adorned%}
{%with fields, full of metals%}. One mg. of Skt. dhātu is {%metal%}
or {%mineral%}; if that is the mg. here, the cpd. might be
rendered {%adorned with kingdoms characterized by minerals%}.
I am very doubtful of this interpretation, but have no
guess which seems to me plausible as to what {@dhātu@},
q.v., means here.
