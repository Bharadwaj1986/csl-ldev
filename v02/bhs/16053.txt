{@samānārthatā@}¦ (in Pali samānattatā, as if *samānāt-
matā, is the 4th saṃgahavatthu), {%equality%}, ({@1@}) in general
sense: LV 239.13 māṃ (sc. the Bodhisattva) °tayā saṃ-
sthāpayati sma, {%he%} (Ārāḍa Kālāpa = °ma) {%set me on terms%}
{%of equality with himself%}; in same incident Mv ii.119.4 samā-
nārthatāye sthāpayet; ({@2@}) as one of the 4 {@saṃgraha-@}
{@vastu@}, q.v., acc. to Bbh 225.21 ff. and Sūtrāl. xvi.72, (a
Bodhisattva's) {%adoption of the same%} (religious) {%aims for%}
{%himself which he preaches to others%}; in lists of the 4 saṃ-
graha-vastu occurs LV 38.17; 160.7; 182.6; 429.13; Mv
ii.395.9; Mvy 928; Dharmas 19. But in Mv i.3.12 the 4th
saṃgraha-vastu is given, instead, as {@samāna-sukha-@}
{@duḥkhatā@} (mss. confused), i.e. {%having the same joys and%}
{%sorrows%} (with others), or {%sympathy%}; this may have been
the older interpretation, and seems to fit better the Pali
equivalent (above), which is so interpreted DN comm.
iii.928.10 ff. The definition in Bbh and Sūtrāl. may then
be a late interpretation of pedantic Mahāyāna metaphy-
sicians.
