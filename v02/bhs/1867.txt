(= Pali a-raṇa, adj. and subst. nt.; araṇā not in Pali
unless, by em. m.c., in Pv iv.1.33 for text araṇa-vihārī,
see CPD s.v.; neg. of Pali, BHS {@raṇa@}, q.v., = {@kleśa@},
Pali kilesa), ({@1@}) adj., {%free from depravity, passion, impurity%},

parvataguhānilayam araṇaṃ vairaparāṅmukhaṃ praśa-
mayuktam; on Av ii.130.2 see s.v. {@araṇya@}; RP 16.3 (vs),
text araṇya-vividhaprānta sevamāno, read araṇa (required
by meter; for °ṇaṃ) vivi°; in some cpds. seemingly adjec-
tival, as araṇāśaya- (misprinted araṇaśaya), {%passionless%}
{%heart%}, Dbh. g. 7(343).7, which suggests that for the corrupt
text maitrapeśi raṇvanāśayo (!) ghanaḥ Gv 482.25 (vs)
we must read maitra peśir araṇāśayo (°aṇva° is unmetr.!)
ghanaḥ; prob. also Mvy 617 araṇa-samavasaraṇa, n. of a
samādhi, cited from ŚsP 1414.17 where {@saraṇa@} is added
after araṇa; Mvy 618, cited from same place; also araṇa-
[Page065-a+ 71]
samādhi, {%passionless samādhi%}, Mv i.164.15, or {%having…%}
(Bhvr.), Mvy 1125 (note that Pali uses araṇa as adj.
with samādhi); ({@2@}) °ṇa, subst. nt., {%freedom from passion%} or
{%depravity, non-passion%}, etc. Mv i.165.5 (vs) sukhaṃ sa-
mādhiṃ araṇāni sevato; in cpds., araṇa-bhāvanayā
Samādh 19.4 (prose; cf. 3, below), {%by bringing to pass%}
{%freedom from kleśas%}; araṇavihārin (= Pali id.), {%dwelling in%}
{%a passionless state%}, Mvy 6366 (here araṇā-vihārin, below,
seems to indicate that araṇa is substantival in force);
({@3@}) araṇā, subst. f. (on Pali see above), in BHS seems =
araṇa nt.; as separate word, in AbhidhK, see below, and
Bbh 89.1 yā ca tathāgatasyāraṇā; in comp., araṇā-vihārin
= araṇa-v°, above; sometimes ā could be m.c., as Divy
401.4; but in prose in the rest; Subhūti is the first of ara-
ṇāvihārin, AsP 20.8; Vaj 26.12; Av ii.131.5--6; AdP,
Konow MASI 69, 13.33; other cpds., pratisamvid-araṇā-
praṇidhi-jñānādīnāṃ (contains a four-member dvandva)
guṇānāṃ Bbh 207.22; araṇā-bhāvanayā Samādh 8.16
(prose, = araṇa-bh°, above, in a closely parallel passage);
araṇā-saṃpannā(ḥ) Mv ii.292.17; in LV 428.13 read with
v.l. araṇā-dharma-supratilabdha for text araṇya°. La
Vallée-Poussin, AbhidhK vii.86--88 defines araṇā as {%le%}
{%pouvoir d'empêcher la naissance de la passion d'autrui%}; but
in my texts it seems to be much less complicated, a simple
equivalent of araṇa. Did it start in verses, m.c. (cf. Pali,
above, Pv iv.1.33), and somehow come thence into prose?
Or (more likely) was araṇā orig. adj. (to 1, above) with a
fem. noun (samāpatti? cf. AbhidhK LaV.-P. iv. 121; or
maitrā, Pali mettā?). See also Renou. JA 1939, 369 note 1.
