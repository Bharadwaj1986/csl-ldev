{@a-vyābādha@}¦, also written {@°vādha@}, in MSV i.97.19
wrongly °vāda, adj. (cf. prec. and next, also {@vyābādha@}
etc.; corresponds to Pali avyāpajjha, avyābajjha), ap-
parently usually {%free from injury, inviolable, secure%}, but
possibly in some passages {%free from injuriousness%}, i.e. {%not%}
{%given to injuring others, kindly%}; the Pali equivalent appears
to be interpreted in the same two ways, but it is not easy
to distinguish them clearly: Mvy 1508 maitrīsahagatena
cittenā 'vaireṇā 'sapatnenā 'vyābādhena; to this passage
corresponds Mv iii.213.13 (cetasā…) avaireṇā 'vyābā-
dhena (so Senart em., mss. 'vyābaddhena or °rddhena);
also Dbh 34.(18--)19 (maitrīsahagatena cittena…) avai-
reṇā 'sapatnenā 'nāvaraṇenā 'vyābādhena; and in Pali
DN ii.242.11 (cetasā…) averena avyāpajjhena; the mg.
[Page080-a+ 71]
{%uninjurious, kindly%} might be assumed in SP 288.8 (prose)
(bodhisattvo…) avyāvādho bhavati, but Kern {%unmo-%}
{%lested%}, and similarly Burnouf. Cf. avyābādhya, said of a
Bodhisattva, Bbh 73.21.
