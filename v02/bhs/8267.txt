[{@nipathī@}¦, LV 372.3 (vs), seems uninterpretable and
has very little ms. support; v.l. (a)narthī, which is metric-
ally and semantically good (see citation s.v. {@granthita@}),
{%disadvantageous%}, and seems implied by Foucaux's transl.;
Tib. omitted in Foucaux but the mg. attributed to Tib.
in his Note (193) to transl. of the BHS LV accords well
with anarthī.]
