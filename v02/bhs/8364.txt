{@? nirgarati@}¦, perhaps rather nirgalati, {%spits out%}: LV
306.21 (prose) nirgaranto; but best mss. nirgalanto; object
ayoguḍāni, {%spitting forth%}. Cf. BR s.v. gal plus nis, nirgali-
tāmbugarbhaṃ śaradghanam Ragh. 5.17, which could
very well mean {%an autumn cloud that has ejected its water-%}
{%content%}. On the other hand, nirgīrṇa is recorded in BR
once from Rām. Neither nir-gṝ nor nir-gal seems recorded
otherwise, in Skt. or MIndic. Since galati is the regular
present to gal, it seems more likely that the best mss. of
LV have the true form, nirgalanto.
