{@samādhyāyika-tā@}¦, said to mean {%acquisition%} or {%pos-%}
{%session of samādhi%} (so Foucaux; Burnouf, Lotus, 798; and
app. Tib. tiṅ ṅe ḥdzin sgrub par): LV 34.6 (prose) prītisaṃ-
bodhyaṅgaṃ dharmālokamukhaṃ °katāyai saṃvartate.
So both edd., no v.l. But I do not understand the formation;
if a cpd., the second member *āyika(-tā) does not seem
plausible ({%leading to%}, as if from ā plus root i?); nor can I
make a plausible analysis by assuming suffixation, starting
with samādhi; perhaps primary formation from Skt.
samādhyāyati, instead of °dhyāyaka-, {%state of one that%}
{%completely concentrates?%}
