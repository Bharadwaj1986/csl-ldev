{@cari@}¦, or {@carī@} (ī chiefly or wholly m.c.), f. (not recorded
in MIndic; = Skt. {@caryā@}, Pali {@cariyā@}, both also in BHS,
see s.vv.; cf. § 3.115), {%course of conduct, regular system of%}
{%action%} (esp. {%religious%}); particularly with reference to the
{%programmatic course%} of a Bodhisattva, leading to enlighten-
ment; (on its four aspects or stages see s.v. {@caryā@};) these
forms chiefly, but not exclusively, in verse; see also
{@cāri, cārikā@}; in prose the usual expression is (Bodhi-
sattva-)caryā, e.g. SP 7.1; 65.5; LV 90.10; Gv 58.9; but
even in prose note (bo) dhisattva-cari-niṣpanda- LV 5.1
(all mss., only Calc. °carita°), and cf. Bhadracari-vidhi-
pūrvakaṃ Śikṣ 139.13 (prose; the bhadra-cari is the
bodhisattva-cari; the work of this name is elsewhere
called Bhadra-caryā in the prose of Śikṣ, 290.8; 291.9;
297.1); in Bhad itself the form is Bhadracari wherever
meter does not require ī, as in the cpd. °cari-praṇidhāna 2,
49, 54, 61, where in the seam of the cpd. the consonant
cluster makes the preceding syllable long; cf. also the acc.
sg. °cariṃ (not °carīṃ) 17, 22, 26, 51, 62; Watanabe
wrongly regards the title as primarily °carī. (All remaining
citations in this article are from verses.) caryā may be
used even in vss, where meter is indifferent (so SP 67.13)
or requires long first syllable (SP 68.6), tho in the latter
case {@cāri (°ī)@} and {@cārikā@}, qq.v., are also found; nearly
all the cases here cited refer to the {%religious course%} leading
to enlightenment, to Buddhahood or Bodhisattvahood,
but occasionally the term is applied to any or all human
courses of action, including such as are disapproved; iya
bāla-carī, {%this foolish%} (or {%childish%}) {%course%} LV 174.9, 11 (vs);
jāniya te cariṃ ca SP 45.3, {%knowing them%} (all the creatures
of the world) {%and their%} (various) {%course%}(s) {%of action%}; cariṃ-
cariṃ jāniya nityakālaṃ vadāmi sattvāna tathā-tathāhaṃ
SP 326.11, {%knowing the various modes of conduct%} (of beings)
{%always, I speak to creatures in this or that way%} (Kashgar
rec., Thomas ap. Hoernle MR 133.1, cari acari, metrically
impossible, and uninterpretable; Thomas {%the moving and%}
{%not-moving%} [of living beings], which seems unacceptable);
jagataḥ prajānase yā carir yatha ca karmasaṃbhavaḥ
RP 6.1; otherwise, referring to the {%course%} of Bodhisattvas,
also called the {%true%} (bhūta), {%subtle%} (sūkṣma), {%pure%} (viśud-
dha), {%supreme%} (uttama) {%course, the course of%} (leading to)
{%enlightenment%} (bodhi-), {%of morality%} (śīla-), or other similar
epithets; also duṣkara-, referring to Śākyamuni's tempo-
rary experiment with severe austerities; often {%former,%}
{%ancient%} (pūrva, {@purima@}) with allusion to the length of
it thru many past births; frequently a form of the cognate
verb car (also ā-car) is used with it: sūkṣmāṃ cariṃ SP
12.7; te (sc. of the Buddha) ātmana yādṛśī carī 63.13;
bhūtāṃ cariṃ 64.2 (but in adjoining prose, 64.13, 65.5,
caryā); 127.10; 193.6; yathā carī mahya sutena cīrṇa
203.4; smara cari purimāṃ LV 161.21; yām evā varacari
(acc.) caritas tvaṃ tām evā cari vibhaja jagasya 164.16;
