{@dṛṣṭa-, (1)@}¦ short for {@dṛṣṭadharma@} or {@°dhārmika@},
in a cpd.: (sarvadharmāṇāṃ)…dṛṣṭasukhasaṃsthānām
abhilāpya-(read with Tib. an-abhi°) -gati-viśeṣāḥ Laṅk
18.7 (prose), {%innumerable different courses of all states-of-%}
{%existence which are based on%} (saṃstha) {%the pleasures of the%}
{%visible%} (world). Suzuki fails utterly to understand the
passage. For the phrase dṛṣṭa dharma, see next; ({@2@}) perhaps
= {@dṛṣṭi@}, {%false view%}: āya-vyaya-dṛṣṭābhiniveśena Laṅk
174.12 (see s.vv. {@āya@} and {@abhiniveśa@}); the alternative
would be to emend to °dṛṣṭy-abhi°.
