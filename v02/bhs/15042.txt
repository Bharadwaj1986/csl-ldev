{@śivika-dvāra@}¦, nt., acc. to Tib. (lho sgo) on 139.15,
{%south gate%} (of a city): MSV iii.139.15 ff. (in 16, °raṃ
rātryāṃ dvau yāmau vivṛtaṃ tiṣṭhati, pūrvakam paścima-
[Page529-a+ 71]
kaṃ ceti, implying a double gate, both parts open); in
iii.137.12 tad eva te °raṃ bhavanam, {%that very same śi° is%}
{%your home%}. I cannot explain śivika; but for Tib., I should
suspect relation to Pali sivikā-gabbha, Vin. ii.152.18, acc.
to comm. = caturassa-g°, {%rectangular%}; but this is equally
obscure. Could śivika, as if {%auspicious%}, be a euphemism
for the unlucky south ?
