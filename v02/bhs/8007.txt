{@nakulaka@}¦, m., ({@1@}) = prec. (1), some musical instru-
ment: Mv ii.322.14; iii.70.15; 82.5 (°kāṃ, acc. pl.); 270.5
(iii.70.15 prose, the others vss); ({@2@}) {%money-bag%} or {%purse%}:
°ko (°kaḥ) kaṭyāṃ (133.23 adds upari) baddhas Divy
124.2; 128.29; 133.23; MSV i.241.8. See under (3). Hertel,
ZDMG 67.125, states that nakula is used in this sense in
Jain Skt. ({@3@}) °kaḥ Mvy 6024, acc. to Jap. {%a purse%} (cf. 2)
{%made out of a mongoose's skin%} (adding that in India purses
[Page288-1b+ 18]
are so made). However, Tib. glosses rgyan ({%ornament%})
ne-ḥu le ({%mongoose%}) can ({%having, with%}), the whole cpd.
interpreted by Das as {%ornament made in the shape of a%}
{%weasel's head%}. Not only Tib. rgyan, which seems to mean
only {%ornament%}, or at least not {%purse%}, but also the context
supports this general sense; it occurs in the midst of a
long list of what are certainly ornaments.
