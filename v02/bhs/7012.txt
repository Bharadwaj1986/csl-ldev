{@tulya@}¦, adj., used in a peculiar sense in SP, and as
I think misunderstood by Burnouf and Kern: {%equal%} in
the sense of {%equally available, open to choice%} (said of different
forms of dharma, {%religion%}, and specifically thinking of the
three yānas): tulye (so with Kashgar rec., text tulya-)
nāma dharmadhātupraveśe SP 60.8 (prose), {%when entrance%}
{%into the sphere of religion is, after all%} (nāma), {%alike%} (all the
same, open to free choice); the sequel complains that the
speaker has been given only the hīna yāna by the Buddha;
tulyeṣu dharmeṣu SP 61.12; 62.2 (both vss). Chinese
versions confirm this interpretation.
