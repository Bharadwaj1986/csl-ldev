{@duṣṭhula@}¦, adj. (also spelled {@°ṣṭū°@}; = Pali duṭṭhulla,
adj. and n.; cf. {@dauṣṭhulya@}; on etym see below), {%wicked,%}
{%grievously evil%}: °lām āpattim Prāt 504.1 (Chin. {%une faute%}
{%grave%}); MSV iii.79.5 (see {@atisārin@}), duṣṭūlāpattiḥ, a-duṣṭu°
Hoernle, MR 12.5 (in a Vinaya fragment), rendered {%grave%}
{%offense, not…%}; in Mvy 8424 °lārocana, 8473 °la-prati-
[Page268-a+ 71]
cchādana, Mironov °lāprati°, {%telling%} and {%(not) concealing%}
{%what is wicked%} (no neg. in Tib. and Chin.), the word could
(but need not) be considered equal to dauṣṭhulya; °la-
samudācārāḥ, {%of wicked behavior%}, MSV ii.200.17 (of the
{@ṣaḍvargika@} monks). In Prāt 479.12 duṣṭhulayā vācā
(cf. Pali Vin. iii.128.22) could be rendered {%with lewd words%}
(making sexual advances to a woman), which acc. to
Childers and PTSD is a special (tho not the exclusive)
mg. of Pali duṭṭhulla; since no other BHS occurrence of
this word or dauṣṭhulya suggests this mg., it seems more
probable that the standard meaning, {%gravely evil%}, prevails
here too. Derivation from Skt. Gr. duṣṭhu (pendant to
Skt. suṣṭhu) has been plausibly suggested by Lévi, Sūtrāl.
vi.2 note 3, and others. Prob. Pali -ulla shows the older
form of the ending: on the Pkt. suffix -ulla cf. Pischel
595. Probably dauṣṭhulya was first constructed as a hyper-
Skt. form from duṭṭhulla; it was restricted to substantive
use, and duṣṭhula (which seems to have been much rarer)
was a back-formation from it, as adj. Leumann, cited by
Wogihara, Lex. 27 f., came fairly close to this suggestion
as an alternative (his first proposal seems to me implau-
sible).
