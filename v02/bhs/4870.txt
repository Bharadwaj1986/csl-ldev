[{@kiṃpuruṣa@}¦, Mv i.23.2, or {@°ṣaka@}, i.20.6; Senart reads
°ṣakānāṃ (all mss. dental n!) in 20.6, °ṣāṇāṃ (but mss.
again end in -kānāṃ!) in 23.2, assuming mg. {%monkey%};
but only by violent em. of mss., which, combining the
two passages, point rather to something like tampuruka
or tamb°; in any case, {%monkey%} is implausible in mg., since
reference seems to be made to animals living in holes;
see s.v. {@gutti@}. I cannot solve this word.]
