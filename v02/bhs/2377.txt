{@asaṃvidita@}¦, perhaps {%unperceived, not consciously%}
{%grasped%}: in Mv i.41.5 and iii.334.8 (both somewhat
corrupt, prob. intending) asaṃviditā asaṃviditapūrvā
(lokāntarikā, sc. nirayā or narakā); in Mv ii.162.10 Senart
also reads asaṃviditapūrvā, mss. (aghā)-saṃvidhipūrvā.
The three other Mv versions of this formulaic passage
have (aghā) aghasaṃbhūtapūrvā, or (aghā) asaṃbhūtā
asaṃbhūtapūrvā. All these are corruptions of an original
prob. to be reconstructed as aghā aghasaṃvṛtā; the Pali
has aghā asaṃvutā (brilliantly corrected by Senart, Mv
i n. 405--6, to aghā aghasaṃvutā); LV and ŚsP aghā
aghasphuṭā ({%full of misery%}, substantially = aghasaṃvṛtā
{%enwrapped in misery%}). See discussion of the passage s.v.
{@lokāntarikā@}.
