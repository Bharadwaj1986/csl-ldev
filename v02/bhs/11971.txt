{@mātrajña-tā@}¦ (also written °jñā-tā, which it seems
must be an error, tho it occurs repeatedly in mss.; once
mātraṃj°, § 2.76; abstr. from prec., = Pali mattaññutā),
{%moderation%} (in eating): Mv iii.265.11 (v.l. mātṛjñātā);
Śikṣ 144.2; Ud xxxii.27 (32); bhojana-mātraṃjñātā LV
430.3--4 (prose), so Lefm., v.l. -mātrajñ°, but apparently
all mss. °jñātā; cf. under {@a-mātr°@}.
