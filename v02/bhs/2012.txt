{@alpāsvāda@}¦, adj. (subst. ? = Pali appassāda), {%affording%}
{%little pleasure%}, in Mv i.121.4 perhaps subst., a sort of
kenning for kāma (the Pali word is often an epithet of
kāma, and sometimes seems to be a substitute for it).
The Mv line (vs) is corrupt; perhaps alpāsvāda-nibaddho
(or read °dhā?) means kāma-nibaddho; in the second
half line surely lokā vartenti dāruṇāḥ is intended, rather
than Senart's em.; as adj., e.g. Divy 41.26 (mahāsamudro)
'lpāsvādo bahvādīnavas.
