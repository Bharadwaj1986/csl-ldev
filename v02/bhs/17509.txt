{@smṛty-upasthāna@}¦, nt. (= Pali satipaṭṭhāna, which,
as Childers says, represents sati-(u)pa° by MIndic saṃdhi),
{%application of mentality, of awareness%} ({%applications de mé-%}
{%moire%}, LaV-P. AbhidhK. vi.153; see the foll. pages); Tib.

{%place%} or {%location of smṛti%}; normally there are ({@1@}) {%four%} such
(same in Pali): listed Mvy 952--956 as kāya-, vedanā-,
citta-, dharma-({%conditions of existence%})-smṛ°; so, with full
discussion of each item, Śikṣ 228.9 ff. (the four terms
228.11; 232.6; 233.15; 236.5); the true nature of each
term must be carefully reflected on; a fuller terminology,
paralleled in Pali (kāyānupassanā- etc.), is kāye kāyānu-
paśyanā-smṛ° Bbh 259.21 (cf. 25 evam avaśiṣṭāni smṛ°
°nāni); so, with °nudarśa- (v.l. °nudarśī, n. sg. of °śin,
showing confusion with the KP formula, below) instead
of °nupaśyanā- Dharmas 44; a slightly different formula
(cf. Pali e.g. DN ii.290.12 ff.), kāye kāyānupaśyī viharati
na ca kāye kāyānupaśyanāyām ātmyadṛṣṭyāṃ patati KP
95.2, and similarly with the other three in ff.; these four
are listed first among the 37 {@bodhipākṣika@} (q.v., or the
like) dharma, Dharmas 43; LV 8.5; 181.17 (here at end
of list of bodhipakṣa-dharma is erroneously added ārya-
satya, but several mss. correctly omit satya); 426.7; Divy
208.7; not in such a list, Śikṣ 105.13; ({@2@}) also {%three%}, more
exactly {@āveṇika@} (q.v.) smṛ° of a Buddha: trīṇy āveṇikāni
smṛ° Mvy 187, listed 188--190 as śuśrūṣamāṇeṣu (aśuśrū°,
śuśrūṣamāṇāśuśrū°) samacittatā, i.e. Buddha is neither
elated nor depressed when his audience is responsive,
unresponsive, or partly both, cf. Bbh 403.10 ff., 15; men-
tioned but not listed Divy 182.20; Av i.7.5; and, without
the word āveṇika, tribhiḥ smṛ° Divy 126.13 (that word
is lacking also Bbh 403.10 ff.); smṛ° mentioned among
āveṇika-buddha-dharma Bbh 230.14; ({@3@}) acc. to AbhidhK.
LaV-P. vi.159 smṛ° is triple, svabhāva- ({%en soi%}; this is
defined simply as = prajñā), saṃsarga- ({%par connexion%}),
and ālambana- ({%en qualité d'objet%}); the two latter defined
160; this distinction I have not noted elsewhere.
