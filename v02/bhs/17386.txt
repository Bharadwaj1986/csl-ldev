{@? styayāntataḥ@}¦, LV 3.22 (vs), uninterpretable; the
preceding pāda is, yasyāpy avandhyāv iha darśana-
śravā; then, after this word (the only v.l. is °takaḥ in Calc.;
s- could possibly be the ending of -śravā, n. pl. for dual)
śāntavimokṣapāragaḥ; Tib. faithfully renders all the rest
but omits this completely. All the three other pādas of
the vs begin with relative pronouns referring to the Bo-
dhisattva; I have thought of reading here yo 'yaṃ tataḥ,
which makes good sense but is remote from the mss.
