{@mahāyaśākhya@}¦, adj., = {@maheśākhya@}, q.v., Śikṣ
303.11 (vs; meter correct). Is this only a hyper-Sktism,
or does it give a clue to the real etymology of maheśākhya
and Pali mahesakkha? {%Having a very glorious name%} fits
the word at least as well, and is in my opinion at least
as plausible etymologically, as the traditional (but rather
mechanical) analysis mahā plus īśa plus ākhyā.
