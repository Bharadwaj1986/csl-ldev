{@Sarvaṃdada@}¦ (cf. {@-dada@}, which see for use of this
word as adj.), n. of a king, previous birth of Śākyamuni:
m.c. Sarvadada RP 22.12 (cf. Finot p. vii, No. 7) °dadena
nṛpeṇa satā me. In Mv iii.250.14 (vs) Senart assumes that
Sarvaṃdada is also the name of a man, but nothing in
the context indicates that it is anything but an adj.,
(an unnamed man) {%who gave away everything%}; the episode
which is told in Mv shows no relation to the story alluded
to in RP.
