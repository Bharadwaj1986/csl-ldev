{@kuṇḍala (1)@}¦ (nt.) {%coil%} (of rope): Jm 23.11 anyatra

varta-kācilindika-sukhasaṃsparśaiś ca tṛṇair, the word
kuṇḍala (vv.ll. kuntala, kuṇṭaka) is obscure; it is omitted
from the cpd. in Foucaux's Tib.; a late Skt. Lex. records
the meaning {%thick%} for kuṇṭaka; this mg. would fit here
but there is no other support for a word kuṇṭaka. On
the other hand, perhaps kuṇḍala-jāta-means simply
{%curling%} (of blades of grass, tṛṇa); cf. {@kuṇḍalaka@} (2) -jāta,
of hair; Foucaux's Note p. 167, bottom, actually cites
this form of the cpd. as the reading of one ms., but adds
that Tib. indicates a reading kuśa-jāta (of this his Tib.
text and its transl. contain no trace); {%curling%} seems to
me a curious epithet to be applied to grass; ({@3@}) (cf. Skt.
Lex. id. = pāśa), {%a ring%} as a kind of fetter: Gv 353.12,
see s.v. {@kaṭaka; (4)@} m., n. of a form of a mendicant,
created magically by Māra to obstruct Buddha: Mv
