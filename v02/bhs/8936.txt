{@parāmṛṣṭa@}¦ (ppp. of prec.; = Pali °maṭṭha; cf.
{@a-parā°@}), {%(unworthily) adhered to%}: Ud xi.4 (= Pali Dhp.
311) śrāmaṇyaṃ duṣparāmṛṣṭam {%evilly adhered to%}; the
next vs 5 is a secondary imitation of this, and only as
such has śrāmaṇyaṃ suparā°, {%well%} or {%properly adhered to%}
(su-parā° is really a contradiction in terms, as if one said
‘a righteous infatuation’); Mvy 7031. [In Ud xiv.7 = MSV
ii.183.4 parāmṛṣṭa = {%considered, deliberate%}, a Skt. mg. of
the verb; so Tib. indicates; MSV ms. paramṛṣṭa, ed.
wrongly em. parimuṣṭa, cf. Pali.The whole vs is substant-
ially right in text of Ud, wrong in MSV.]
