{@pratisaṃkhyā@}¦ (= Pali paṭisaṃkhā; see {@aprati-@}
{@saṃkhyā@}), {%careful (point by point) consideration, thorough%}
{%knowledge%}, in °khyā-nirodha, {%suppression%} (of rebirth) {%by…%},
one of the 3 asaṃskṛtāni (see {@asaṃskṛta@}); it is a synonym
of nirvāṇa: Mvy 2185; Dharmas 32; see esp. La Vallée
Poussin, AbhidhK. i.8-9 ({%suppression due à la sapience%}).
In Mv ii.283.14 Senart reads by em. -jñānadarśana-
pratisaṃkhāya (for °khyāya) for mss. °saṃlāpa, or acc.
to note °saṃlāya; but the em. is not supported and seems
implausible; the parallels Mv i.228.12, ii.132.16 read
°pratilābhāya or °ye; LV 344.7 °sākṣātkriyāyai.
