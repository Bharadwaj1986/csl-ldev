{@paritasyati@}¦ (= {@paritrasyati, °sati@}; Pali paritassati,
°tasati, which seems to be blended with derivs. of Skt.
tṛṣ-; cf. MN i.136.16 (na) paritassati; comm. ii.111.11 ff.
glosses, bhaya-paritassanāya taṇhā-paritasanāya vā na
paritassati, {%is not disturbed either by fear (?) of danger or%}
{%desire(?) for cravings%}, distinguishing the two nouns pari-
tassanā and °tasanā but associating both with the verb
paritassati; the forms with -tras- may indicate the true
origin, or may be hyper-Skt., association with root tras-
being then secondary; cf. Dhātup. tas = upakṣaye, but
with var. upakṣepe), {%is wearied, exhausted, troubled, dis-%}
{%turbed%}; cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. vi.145 note 5 paritasyati,
upakṣīyata ity arthaḥ (see s.v. {@paritāsa@}): na °syati Mvy

word occur with other forms mentioned in this article)

{%cease%}; so Chin. and Jap.; notkaṇṭhyate (see {@utkaṇṭhati@})
na °syati Bbh 193.6; a-paritasyamānaḥ Bbh 218.9. Cf.
{@a-paritasyana(tā)@}, and Wogihara, Lex. 32 ff.; Leumann's
theory there cited seems hardly conclusive.
