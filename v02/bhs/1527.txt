{@abhinirharati@}¦ (= Pali abhinīharati, the definitions
of which in the Pali Dictt. do not fit BHS usage; cf.
{@abhinirhāra@}, more rarely {@°haraṇa@}, n. act. to this verb,
with about the same range of mgs.; one or two passages
containing the verb, cited there, are not repeated here),

something in oneself); na ca tāvad divyaṃ śrotram
abhinirharati SP 357.4--5 and 8, {%and yet he does not realize%}

that he has certain marvelous powers of hearing); SP

may be a second object of vicintaya); LV 180.6 praṇi-

(reflected on) {%what he had undertaken%} (? produced, realized?
or initiated, taken upon himself?); but in parallel passage
MSV ii.128.3 and 180.5 abhinirhṛta-piṇḍapātaḥ evidently
means, {%when alms-food had been produced%} (entertainment
provided by a layman), and I suspect a corruption in
mantrayate of Divy, see s.v. {@aupadhika@} (2); with cittam
