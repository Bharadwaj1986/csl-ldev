{@yan (yaṃ) nu@}¦ (cf. next; in Pali represented by yan
nūna), conj., {%suppose now%}, with opt. of 1st person; ex-
tremely common in most texts, but I have failed to note
it in Mv, which uses {@yan nūna(ṃ)@} instead: SP 73.2, 14;
322.1; LV 14.16; 95.22; 101.5; 137.17; Divy 95.10; Av
i.3.4; Samādh 19.12, 14; etc.; in text of MSV regularly
printed yat tu (yat tv aham…), possibly by misreading?
(e.g. i.90.1).
