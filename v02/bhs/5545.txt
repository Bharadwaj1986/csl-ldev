{@? khodaka@}¦, m. (so text; cited pw 7.336 as khoṭaka,
without annotation; cf. next), acc. to Divy, Index, and
pw, {%pot%}: tena śarkarā-°ko labdhaḥ Divy 29.14. This may
be right; but if reading of text is correct, the word could
be related to AMg. khoda (in khododaga), khoya, {%sugar-%}
{%cane%}; or even to Skt. kṣoda, {%piece%} (pw s.v. 5); any of these
mgs. would make possible sense. Uncertain.
