{@ucchitya?@}¦ seemingly ger.; so mss., Divy 103.22
…unmādam api prāpnoty ucchitya vā kālaṃ karoti.
Ed. em. ucchritya, which seems to make no sense; it
means {%having lifted, raised up%}, trans., and there is no
object here; even if intrans., {%having risen%}, I do not see
that it makes sense. There is some corruption, but I see
no good em.
