{@jātaka@}¦, nt., rarely m., ({@1@}) m. pl., {%experiences in past%}
{%births%}, particularly of Bodhisattvas: Bbh 67.17 (sa tena
pūrve-)nivāsānusmṛtijñānena jātakān pūrvāṃ bodhisat-
tvacaryā-paramādbhutacaryāṃ sattvānāṃ buddhe…
prasādajananārthaṃ…prakāśayati, {%by this knowledge%}
{%consisting of remembrance of former births he reveals to%}
{%creatures, in order to make them well-disposed to the Buddha,%}
{%his experiences in past births%} etc.; 397.13 (pūrvenivāsā-
nusmṛtijñānabalena tathāgataḥ pūrvānte itivṛttakāṃś)
ca jātakāṃś ca smṛtvā…vineyānāṃ deśayati; this
[Page240-b+ 71]
usage, which is prob. only a late and secondary extension
of the next mg., seems not recorded in Pali; ({@2@}) nt., = Pali
id., {%a story of a previous birth%} of the Buddha, common
esp. in colophons to many such stories in Mv, e.g. i.282.13;
also as n. of a work or type of literature, sometimes, at
least, referring to a specific collection of such stories like
the Pali Jāt.: as one of the nine (Mvy twelve) pravacana,
{%gospel texts%} (Mvy dharma-pra°), Dharmas 62; Mvy 1275;
in a similar list, SP 45.7; Jātake Śyāmākajātakaprabhṛtiṣu
Karmav 50.6, {%in the Jātaka%} (collection), {%in the Śyāmāka%}
(individual) {%Jātaka and others like it%}, combining both these
mgs. in one phrase; ({@3@}) in Mv i.104.13; 105.5, 7; 192.19
taken by Senart in sense 2 above, but I think wrongly;
I believe it means {%nativity%} in the sense of (astrologically
determinable) {%personality and destiny%}, as in Skt.; or
possibly {%future birth%}. This seems to me indicated by
adjoining parallel terms, esp. {@paramata@}, q.v., which
Senart misunderstands: (bodhisattvacaritaṃ…) jātakā-
paramateṣu kovidā (deśayanti…īśvarā) Mv i.104.13 (vs;
kā for -ka, m.c.), {%the Lords%} (Buddhas), {%being skilled in%}
{%nativities%} (indicating personality and destiny; or, future
births) {%and in the thoughts of others, proclaim the%} (future!)
{%course of Bodhisattvas…%}; (yānīmāni)…jātakāni jina-
bhāṣitāni imāni kutaḥprabhṛtikāni vijñeyāni (? em.; mss.
ciṃhneyāni) 105.5, answered by: yānīmāni…jātakāni
jinabhāṣitāni imāṃ aṣṭamīṃ bhūmiṃ (so some mss.)
prapadyanti (v.l. prayanti) 105.7; the mg., as Senart
suggests, seems (from -prabhṛtikāni) to be that they
{%begin%} with the 8th bhūmi; but as this passage occurs in
a description of the 4th bhūmi, it is {%future%} births or
destines that are meant. In i.192.19 (vs), after saṃ-
buddhāḥ sarvaparamataṃ viduḥ 18, {%Buddhas know all%}
{%the thoughts of others%}, we read: adhyāśayaṃ parīkṣanti
jātakā sarvaprāṇināṃ, {%they perceive the disposition and%}
{%the destinies%} (future births) {%of all living beings%}.
