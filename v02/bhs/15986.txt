{@samaya, (1)@}¦ {%time%}, as in Skt.; app. nt. (Skt. only m.)
in LV 210.2, see s.v. {@ardharātri@}; tena samayena (as in
Pali), {%at that time%}, very common in phrase introducing a
new episode, tena khalu punaḥ samayena (Pali tena kho
pana sa°), {%now, however, at that time…%}, SP 19.11; LV
18.14; 238.14; Vaj 19.14; Mv i.35.14, etc. (in many pas-
sages, incl. some of these, a voc. intervenes between punaḥ
and sam°); ({@2@}) (Pali id.; not in Skt., not even in Vedic;
AV 2.35.3 is to be taken otherwise, see Ludwig RV 3.302)
{%assembly, congregation, concourse%} (of persons), = Skt.
samiti: punar api devasamaye yadā satyāṃ prakāśayet
Mv i.250.15 = 251.1 (vs); a rare usage, here and seemingly
in Pali; ({@3@}) nt., a high number: Gv 133.9, cited in Mvy
7857 as {@samarya@}, q.v.; the corresp. form in Gv 105.26
seems to be {@sāmpa@} (prob. corrupt).
