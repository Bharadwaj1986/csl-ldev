{@? pravādī@}¦, f., n. sg. {@°di@} m.c., {%disputation, argument%}:
śūnyā pravādi iha īdṛśa-dharma-yoge (so, one word) LV
420.20 (vs), {%empty (vain) is discussion regarding this applica-%}
{%tion to such a kind of doctrine%} (of heretics, mentioned in
prec. line). So Tib. seems clearly to understand: chos
sbyor ḥdi ḥdra ḥdi la rab tu rtsod pa stoṅ, which definitely
opposes taking pravādi as loc. for °de; this construction
would in any case be difficult, since śūnyā could then not
agree with this word (as Tib. makes it and as natural
interpretation requires); to take śūnyā with bhūmir in
prec. line would be forced. No v.l. is recorded for pravādi
(Calc. with some mss. reads śūnya-); perhaps it should be
em. to °da (n. sg., for °daḥ).
