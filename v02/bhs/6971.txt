{@tiṣṭhantika@}¦, adj. (= pres. pple. tiṣṭhant-; we should
expect °ta-ka, but there is no v.l.; -ika is abnormal here;
gender is m.), {%remaining%} (in the world, of Buddhas, con-
trasting with nirvṛta, {%entered into nirvāṇa%}): dattā aprati-
meṣu maitramanasā tiṣṭhantike (so read, both edd. °t
ke) nirvṛte LV 291.14 (vs), {%were given with loving heart%}
{%to the Matchless Ones%} (Buddhas), {%to%} (one) {%that was remaining%}
{%in the world%}, (and) {%to%} (another) {%who had entered nirvāṇa%}.
Cf. Senart, Mv i.568, who reads this word correctly,
equating it with tiṣṭhamāno (mahāvīro) i.252.12, but
wrongly understands 'nirvṛte; Tib., at least, supports my
interpretation: byams paḥi yid kyis do zla med par bzhugs
({%remaining%}) daṅ ({%and%}) mya ṅan ḥdas la (= nirvṛta) phul.
