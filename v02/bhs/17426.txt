{@sthita-lapa@}¦ (v.l. sthita-raya), °pā (n.pl.), Mv i.134.10,
of Bodhisattvas; foll. by {@akāmakāmin@}, q.v. Senart sug-
gests taking sthita as {%stopped%}, virtually = sthāpita, a mg.
which is not recorded for it in Pali, and in Skt. is supported,
if at all, by Ind. Spr. 6986 na sthitaḥ, {%you didn't stop%}.
If this somewhat dubious suggestion is accepted, I would
assume {@lapa@}, q.v., in the mg. of {@lapana@}, and render
{%having abandoned boasting%} (in the sense of {@lapana@}). Other-
wise Senart.
