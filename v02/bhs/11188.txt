{@bhavi-vādi-kathā?@}¦ Mv i.144.13 (prose), so mss.;
Senart bhava°: (Bodhisattvas in their mothers' wombs)
°kathāṃ kathayanti kuśalamūlata iti; one ms. bhaviṣya°
for bhavi°; perhaps, then, bhavin = Skt. bhāvin, {%relating%}
{%to the future?%} or, (of) {%living beings%} (so, tho rarely, Skt.
bhavin)? or again, for Skt. bhavya, as bhavi- is used in
Ap. (Jacobi, Bhav., Glossar)?
