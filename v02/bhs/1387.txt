{@a-prativartiya@}¦ (semi-MIndic for °tya; = Pali ap-
paṭivattiya), {%not to be turned back%} (by any creature; said
of the dharmacakra, once set in motion by a Buddha):
Mv iii.327.7 (vs, no v.l.); in Mv i.330.4 (prose) doubtless
[Page048-a+ 71]
read so with 1 ms., the other pravartayaṃ, Senart em.
apravartiyaṃ; in Mv i.331.4 Senart with mss. apravartiyaṃ,
in 332.7 apravartitaṃ, which is read in the same formula
SP 179.1 (prose, no v.l.); in Mv i.332.21 aparivartitaṃ,
in 333.12 apravartiyaṃ, v.l. aparivartiya. In Pali ap-
parently only appaṭi° occurs, and I believe this must
have been the original reading. No being could {%turn back%}
the wheel started by the Buddha. But evidently in BHS
tradition this became confused with forms (ppp. as well
as gdve.) of pra-, pari-vṛt-, which of course also yield
a tolerable sense: {%which had never been set in motion%} or
{%could not be set in motion%} by any (other) being.
