{@Nārāyaṇa, (1)@}¦ (also {@Mahā-n°@}, q.v.; presumably the
name of the Hindu god, but used in BHS as a proverbially
powerful personage; so also in Pali, see DPPN s.v. Nārā-
yana-saṃghāṭa-bala, {%‘name given to a certain measure of%}
{%physical strength…[it] was the strength of the Buddha’%};
but in MPS 31.21 Buddha has the power of many hundreds
of Nārāyaṇas): Nārāyaṇa-balam Mvy 8214 = Tib. sred
med buḥi ({%of Nārāyaṇa%}, so Das; lit. seems to mean {%of son%}
{%of the desireless one%}) stobs ({%strength%}); °ṇa-sthāmavān LV
109.11; 110.8; 291.15 (all vss), {%having the might of N%}.
(Tib. on the last, sred med bu yi mthu ldan pa); °ṇa-
saṃhananakāyaḥ SP 428.9--10, said of a Bodhisattva;
°ṇa-saṃhananaḥ MSV i.271.10; vajradṛḍha abhedya nārā-
yaṇo ātmabhāvo guru LV 202.17 (vs) = Tib. sku ({%body%})
ni sred med bu yi stobs ldan ({%having the strength of N%}.),
which seems to imply that Tib. took nārāyaṇo as an adj.,
{%Nārāyaṇa-like%} (in strength); it could perhaps be under-
stood as for °ṇa-, in comp. with -ātmabhāva (§ 8.12),
{%having the body of a N%}. (i.e. like N.); sarvaparvasu caikas-
min (read caikaikasmin?) parvaṇi Nārāyaṇa-bala-saṃni-
viṣṭatā (…{%a state of being invested with the power of N%}.)
Bbh 74.27; see the similar cases s.vv. {@Ardhanārāyaṇa,@}
{@Mahānārāyaṇa; (2)@} n. of a Buddha: Śikṣ 169.12; ({@3@}) n.
of a yakṣa: Suv 161.6; ({@4@}) n. of a nāga-king: Māy 247.4.
