{@bhrama@}¦ (m.? Skt. Lex. {%spring%}), {%water-course, conduit%},
in {@udaka-bhrama@}, q.v.; and in Divy 538.10, where text
Kubjottarānukrameṇa niṣpalāyitā; mss. are cited as
reading -bhrameṇa, which must certainly be kept; it is
not clear whether the syllable -nu- is in the mss. or not;
if it is, we should have to assume an otherwise unknown
stem anubhrama; if not, since Kubjottarā is fem., bhra-
meṇa gives excellent sense. See Lévi, Karmav p. 269.
