{@samāpatti@}¦, f., primarily (as in Skt.) {%attainment%} (to
{@samāpadyate@}, Skt. and BHS); esp. used (as in Pali) of
the {%attainment%} of the nine successive {@anupūrvavihāra@}
(q.v. for list) or 'successive states induced by the ecstatic
meditation' (Childers, who lists only eight, as sometimes
in Pali; add as ninth [saññāvedayita-] nirodha-sam°);
these states are also called {@samādhi@}; navānupūrvasamā-
dhi-samāpattayaḥ Dharmas 82 clearly = {%attainment of%}
{%the nine successive samādhi%}; so also Laṅk 100.9 samādhi-
samāpatty-adhiṣṭhānena, see {@adhiṣṭhāna@}; and in some
other such cpds. But from this old association, in Pali
and BHS alike, the {%attainment%} comes to mean the {%state%}
{%attained%}, viz. one of the above nine (in Pali sometimes
only eight, the nirodha-sa° being omitted) ‘modes of
abstract meditation’ (Hardy ap. Childers), or {%recueille-%}
{%ments%}, LaV-P. in AbhidhK, see esp. viii.182 n. 4 for a
report of discordant Buddhist attempts to distinguish
between {@samādhi@} and {@samāpatti@}. The fact seems to be
that these two words are fundamentally and substantially
identical in mg., and that the attempts to differentiate
are scholastic pedantry. They are however used in dvandva
cpds., sometimes with dhyāna too (note that the 4 {@dhyāna@}
are included in the 9 samāpatti): dhyāna-samādhi-°ttīnāṃ
LV 244.3, Tib. bsam gtan (dhyāna) daṅ tiṅ ṅe ḥdzin
(samādhi) daṅ sñom par ḥjug pa, as a three-member
dvandva. This is the regular Tib. rendering of samāpatti,
[Page570-a+ 71]
{%entering%} (ḥjug pa) {%into equanimity, evenness or calmness of%}
{%mind%} (sñom par). This Tib. expression is, however, not
always parallel with tiṅ ṅe ḥdzin = samādhi, which may
depend upon it, as in LV 3.11 where samādhiṃ samāpanno
'bhūt, containing the cognate ppp., is rendered tiṅ ṅe
ḥdzin la sñoms par zhugs par gyur to, {%arrived at equanimity-%}
{%entrance into samādhi%}, or {%at entrance into equanimity%}
(leading) {%to samādhi%}. Mvy 1491--1502 contains eleven (in
Mironov only ten, 1499 being omitted) miscellaneous and
unsystematic ‘{%names of%} (various sorts of) {%samāpatti%}’;
1492--5 are brief statements of the ārūpyasamā° (see
{@ārūpya@} for other citations); the others are {@vyutkrān-@}
{@taka-sa°, vyāskandaka-sa°@}, (nava-){@anupūrvavihāra-@}
{@sa°, samāpatti-skandhaḥ@} (om. Mironov), {@nirodha-@} (more
fully {@saṃjñāvedayita-nirodha-@}){@sa°, mahābhūtasama-@}
{@tāsādhanam@}, and {@asaṃjñā-sa°@}, qq.v.; (bodhisattvasya

it hard to draw a line between the two shades of mg.;
