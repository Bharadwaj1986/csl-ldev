2 {@Prakṛti@}¦, n. of an outcaste girl (mātaṅga-dārikā):
Mvy 3665; Divy 611.6 ff.; also of a previous incarnation
of the same person, when she was a brahman's daughter,
Divy 620.22 ff. Acc. to Senart, i.xliv infra, also n. of
another girl, who plays a role in the story of {@Megha@};
but I believe this is an error. The girl is introduced but
not named Mv i.232.13; she is then referred to as prakṛti
(for °tī) māṇavikā 232.16, and, in oblique forms, °tiye
°vikāye 233.14; 238.3; there is no indication that these
passages state her name, and I believe they contain the
Skt. adj. (ppp.) prakṛta, {%above-mentioned%} (BR 2.95), in
fem. form (°tī, § 11.3).
