{@bhrūṇa-dheya@}¦ (see {@-dheya@}), in °yam idaṃ cittaṃ
niḥsāram anidarśanam Ud xxxi.4. This cpd. of -dheya not
recorded in Pali; is it a false Sktization of the trouble-
some Pali word bhūna-ha or °hu? This word the Pali
comms. seem evidently to misunderstand. Cf. Renou,
JA 1939, p. 348 with n. 1, who connects the Pali word
with Vedic and Skt. bhrūṇa-han; acc. to his note 1, the
Skt. form is to be ‘restored’ in Dharmasamuccaya 16.8.
Renou apparently did not know our BHS form, which
seems only to complicate the question further. It is clear,
in any case, that it is an uncomplimentary epithet. The
Pali comms. interpret the Pali as {%destroying prosperity%} or
{%welfare%}.
