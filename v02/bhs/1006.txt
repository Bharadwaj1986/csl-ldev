{@anuvarga@}¦ (m. ? = Pali °vagga, see below), some part
or accessory of a city gate: dvinnāṃ varṇānāṃ anuvargā
abhunsuḥ (sc. teṣāṃ dvārāṇāṃ) Mv i.195.(11--)12. Cf.
Pali Bv i.14 tulā saṃghāṭānuvaggā sovaṇṇaphalakatthatā.
CPD interprets anuvaggā as adj., citing comm., = anurūpā.
But this is proved wrong by Mv; like tulā, which occurs
in the prec. line of Mv, it must be a part of a structure.
See Senart's note for a conjectural attempt at interpreta-
tion.
