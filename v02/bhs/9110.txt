bodhisattvasya paribhogo 'bhūt, refers to a physical (tho
of course magical) structure, described in detail 63.1 ff.,
which houses the Bodhisattva in his mother's womb; it
had three turrets or apartments, kūṭāgāra, one within the
other, and within the third a couch or litter, paryaṅka;
it was hard ‘like vajra’ yet soft to the touch (64.7--8); all
the bhavana-vyūha of the kāmāvacara gods appeared in
it (64.9); it always develops or appears in the right side
of a Bodhisattva's mother in his last earthly existence
(65.20, here called {@ratnavyūhaḥ@}, q.v., kūṭāgāro); in 73.3
referred to again, drakṣasi (so text and app. all mss.)

but to structures occupied by bodhisattvas while attending
on the Buddha Śākyamuni.
