{@Siddhārtha, (1)@}¦ (= Pali Siddhattha), personal name
of Śākyamuni (Buddha; in Mv and LV more commonly
{@Sarvārthasiddha@}): Mvy 49; 3603 (here in a list of ‘cakra-
vartin kings’ but following the names of his Śākyan elders);
Gv 439.2; Mv ii.75.19 (after Sarvārthasiddha, 18); iii.330.7
(mss.); LV 209.3; 226.17; 252.6; ({@2@}) n. of another, future
Buddha: Mv iii.330.8; but I believe the passage is cor-
rupt, and that actually Śākyamuni is here referred to a
second time (as well as in line 7, see above); note that
Maitreya is named next in line 8; ({@3@}) n. of a son of Māra
(favorable to the Bodhisattva): LV 312.21; ({@4@}) n. of a
yakṣa: Māy 69.
