{@Saṃjñāya@}¦ (mss. mostly Saṃjaya, but Tib. yaṅ dag
śes, supporting Nobel's reading), n. of a yakṣa prince or
commander (senāpati): Suv 85.1; 91.16; 128.3 ff. (chap. XI,
°ya-parivarta); 158.13 (here called janarṣabhaḥ, so read
with best mss., others nararṣabhaḥ; Nobel's jinarṣabhaḥ,
based on Tib., seems to me clearly wrong, cf. Nobel's
note 14 above where N. corrects the same Tib. reading;
context proves that a yakṣa, not a Buddha, is meant);
161.7.
