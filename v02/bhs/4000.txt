{@ṛtu-pariṇāma@}¦ and {@ṛtu-vipariṇāma:@} cf. Pali utu-
pariṇāma, {%change of season%}, as a source of disease, e.g.
AN ii.87.30--31 (vedayitāni…) utupariṇāma-jāni (comm.
iii.114.19 = utupariṇāmato atisīta-atiuṇha-ututo jātāni);
ṛtupariṇāmāye, Mv ii.15.6 (Senart wrongly), or ṛtuvipari°
ii.424.(3--)4, perh. adj. {%subject to change of season%}; or, prob.
reading °nāma-tāye, {%because of change of season?%}; in vipā-
canīye grahaṇīye samanvāgatā nāpy atiśītāye nāpy
atiuṣṇāye (424.3 na cāti° both times) ṛtu- (424.4 ṛtu-vi-)
pariṇāmāye. A like passage Mv i.211.7 reads, instead of
ṛtu(vi)pari°, in the mss. samāye cintamatāye (v.l. vinta°),
which is obscure; Senart em. sammāpariṇāmāye, but this
seems violent; samāye seems sound, as it occurs just
before. Senart understands this as {%causing good digestion%},
and infers that ṛtu-pari° means the same. He does not
mention ii.424.3--4, which reads vipariṇāma; this, unlike
pariṇāma, seems never to be used in Skt., Pali or Pkt.
in the sense of {%digestion%}; and the established Pali cpd.
utu-pariṇāma certainly goes against Senart's view. The
only question is, can ṛtupariṇāmāye, fem., be an adj.
going with grahaṇīye, or should we take it as a noun?
In the latter case an em. to °matāye seems probable.
