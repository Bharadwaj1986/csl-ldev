{@? jighāṃsita@}¦ (should be ppp. of desid. of han-! but
in mg. = {@jighatsita!@}), clearly means {%hungry%} in Karmav
46.9 °ta-pipāsitasya kruddhasya kālakriyā; so Tib. bkres
śiṅ skom pa, {%hungry and thirsty%}; and so Lévi translates,
without any note, tho a note is surely needed! So v.l.
for Mvy 7328, see prec. It seems likely that the true
reading is jighatsita; or dare we assume that MIndic
(Pali) jighacchita was falsely Sktized as jighāṃsita ?
