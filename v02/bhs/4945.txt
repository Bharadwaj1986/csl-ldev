{@kuṇḍaka@}¦, adj., presumably = {@kuṇḍa@} 2, {%maimed%} (in
the hand ?): SP 95.5 (vs) te kuṇḍakā (Kashgar rec. khuḍ-
ḍakā) {@laṅgaka@} (q.v.) bhonti tatra; WT keep kuṇḍakā,
altho their ms. Ḱ reads kuṇṭhakā (see s.v.), because
Kumārajīva's Chinese, they say, this time is different
and suggests kuṇḍa of Mvy.
