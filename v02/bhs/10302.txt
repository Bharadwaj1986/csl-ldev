{@pratyeka-@}¦, adj., chiefly as prior member of cpds.
(but cf. pratyekāṃ bodhiṃ Divy 294.10; Av i.99.17;
°kāyāṃ bodhau Divy 70.6; 209.16; °kā bodhiḥ Av i.136.7),
primarily as in Skt., {%for a single person, individual, personal%};
esp. common in {@pratyekabuddha@} and other cpds. showing
this mg., see the foll. items; in some BHS cpds., in part
with equivalents in Pali, this seems to have developed
special connotations, possibly owing to the standard con-
trast between a pratyekabuddha's rating (far inferior)
and that of a real (samyak-saṃ-)buddha. So {@pratyeka-@}
{@niraya@} (Pali pacceka-n°) or {@°naraka@} seems clearly to be
a place of less severe punishment than a (mahā-, or regular)
niraya: note Mv i.103.(7-)9 (yadi kecit, sc. bodhisattvāḥ,
kathaṃcid…avīciṃ mahānirayaṃ gacchanti, atha khalu)
pratyekanirayaṃ gacchanti (text adds, they are never
born as pretas, asuras, etc.); also Mv ii.350.10, 12; pratyeka-
narakaḥ Mvy 4944 = Tib. ñi tshe baḥi ({%ephemeral; single,%}
{%simple%}, Jä.; Das adds, {%very small, minute; animals that do%}
{%not live more than a day%}) sems can ({%creatures%}) dmyal ba
({%hell%}), app. then {%a hell in which creatures live for a short%}
{%time%}; Chin. {%individual hell%}; no Jap. rendering; iha pratyeka-
narakeṣūpapannāḥ…asmābhir itaś cyutair narakeṣūpa-
pattavyaṃ bhaviṣyati (app. for further, more serious
punishment) Divy 335.25; bahuśaṅkur nāma pratyekana-

narakaṃ (n. sg.!) Śikṣ 136.10; °narakān Bbh 151.16;
°narakaḥ Karmav 53.13-14; (tasminn eva janmani)
pratyekasvargaṃ pra°narakaṃ (n. sg.) cānubhūtam 57.2
(refers to story of which 53.13-14 is part); here {%private,%}
{%personal heaven%} and {%hell%} seem to fit, since the one who
experiences both seems to be a single individual (at a given
time; a former inhabitant of the pra°naraka is released
as the new one arrives); pratyeka-rājan Mv ii.270.10 (see
s.v. {@pṛthu@}), contrasting with cakravartin, either {%minor,%}
{%subordinate%}, or {%individual%} (belonging to a single land?);
[Page379-a+ 71]
pratyeka-brahman (= Pali pacceka°, PTSD {%an independent%}
{%Brahma%}), Karmav 34.8, see s.v. {@Baka@} (Lévi, {%devenu un des%}
{%Brahmas%}, which can hardly suffice); in Mv i.103.1, most
strangely, the words brāhmaṇa and pratyeka-brā° seem
used for (the god) Brahman and pratyeka-brahman:
(bodhisattvā avaivartikadharmā…never enter an evil
existence,) atha khalu brāhmaṇā bhavanti pratyekabrāh-
maṇā vā indrāś ca upendrāś ca yakṣādhipatayaś ca yakṣāś
ca…(note parallelism between pratyeka-br°, contrasting
with br°, and upendra and yakṣa, contrasting with Indra
and yakṣādhipati).
