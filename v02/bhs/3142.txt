{@idaṃpratyaya-tā@}¦ (= Pali idappaccayatā; abstr.
from prec.), {%state of having this%} (or {%that%}) {%as its cause%}; gener-
ally in comp. with pratītya-samutpāda, {%dependent origina-%}
{%tion owing to the state of%} (etc.); so also the Pali equivalent
is usually cpd. with paṭiccasamuppāda (or °panna), tho
the editions wrongly separate the words, as in Vin. i.5.1:
idaṃpratyayatā-pratītyasamutpādam Gv 89.13; Bbh
204.25; 396.21; °pādena Bbh 110.23; °pādānulomāḥ Bbh
303.22.
