{@utkrośayati@}¦ (denom. to AMg. ukkosa, see below),
{%exalts, magnifies%}: AsP 419.4 ātmānam utkrośayati parān
paṃsayati.The AMg. ukkosa is derived by Sheth and
Ratnach. from utkarṣa (or utkṛṣṭa) and defined as adj.,
{%highest, supreme%}, or, as n., {%pride%}. If this is the true etym.,
our word would be a hyper-Sktism, by false etym. Possibly,
however, the AMg. word may really represent a Skt.
*utkrośa, which, like Eng. {%a crying-up%}, could conceivably
have meant {%glorification%}. To be sure I find no record,
otherwise, of such a mg. in any deriv. of ut-kruś.
