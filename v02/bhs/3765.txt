{@upalambha@}¦ (cf. Skt. id.; not recorded in Pali; cf.
prec., {@an-upa°, an-upalabdhi@}, the next items, and
{@aupalambhika@}), acc. to standard interpretation, {%mental%}
{%perception%} or {%apperception, realization by the intellect%};
Sūtrāl. xviii.92 comm. buddhyā pratipattiḥ; Tib. dmigs

upalabdhi.Were it not for this persistent tradition, some
occurrences, esp. of the neg. forms ({@an-upalambha,@}
{@°labdhi@}), could easily be interpreted as related to upa-
labhyate (1) and mg. (non-){%occurrence%}, (non-){%existence%}.
These mgs. are attributed by CPD to an-upaladdhi,
°labbhana; and tho not recognized in PTSD, {%occurrence,%}
{%existence%} seems to me the probable mg. of upaladdhi in
the two passages cited for it, Miln. 268.7 and Vv. comm.
279.10. In many BHS places {%inconceivability%} or {%non-%}
{%occurrence, non-reality%} would make equally good sense
for an-upa°. I do not, however, venture to abandon what
[Page140-b+ 71]
seems to have been the standard tradition. Reliance on
upalambha, {%mental perception, fancy%}, is an error, stigmatized
as upalambha-dṛṣṭi, {%the heresy that relies on upalambha%},
LV 35.6 (or as Bhvr., {%one who adheres to that heresy%}, SP
383.12); see also °dṛṣṭika. Similarly upalambha-saṃjñin
Śikṣ 315.1, {%having the%} (false) {%notion of upalambha%}; upalam-
bha-yogena, {%by the%} (erroneous) {%method of upalambha%}, ŚsP
1042.16, repeated formulaically (cf. anupalambha-yogena
s.v. {@anupalambha@}).
