pṛṣṭhibhūtaḥ, and in 11 avapṛṣṭhīkṛtaḥ, both seem to
have the mg. suggested by Pali vipiṭṭhikatvā(na), above:
{%(made) averse, turned away%} (from worldly things); see the
passage cited s.v. {@Maitrīya@}. In Mvy 2590, also, pṛṣṭhī-
bhavati may have this mg., {%becomes averse%} (followed by
{@kelāyita@}, q.v., in a chapter headed ‘{%synonyms%} of {@nisṛjā@}’);
but the two Tib. renderings are not clear; pw 7.359 under-
stands this as belonging to (2); of course pw's assumption
that the ‘correct reading’ is piṣṭī° is wrong; ({@2@}) {%becomes%}
{%depressed%} (= {@vipṛṣṭhībhavati@}, q.v.), orig. doubtless
{%turns one's back%} as a sign of unhappiness: cittaṃ nāvalīyate
