{@? triphala@}¦ (m. or nt.), in °la-vāhakā dārakāḥ LV
132.18 (prose), form uncertain (vv.ll. triphara, trisphara,
tisthara; Calc. tila); acc. to Tib. khriḥu, {%a small stool%} or
{%chair, seat%}; Foucaux's Note 126 suggests reading tri(s)pada
(Skt. tripadikā is recorded as {%tripod%} in a lexical citation,
BR, and tripāda allegedly in Kauś. but not in 26.41 as
BR state).
