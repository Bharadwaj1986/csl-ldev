{@pravaṇṇa@}¦, adj.-ppp. (= AMg. pavaṇṇa; semi-MIndic
for Skt. prapanna), {%resorted to%}: raudrair narair aśubha-
karma-m-ati-pravaṇṇaiḥ Mv i.84.3 (vs), {%by violent men%}
{%who resort too much to evil deeds%}. So one ms., the rest
°pravarṇaiḥ, which makes no sense; Senart em. °vaṇaiḥ,
but his note recognizes that the penult is required by meter
to be long; he suggests that doubling of ṇ of pravaṇa took
place m.c. But the AMg. form fits without change.
