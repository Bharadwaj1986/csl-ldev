{@ucchaṅkha-, ucchaṅga-, utsaṅga-@}¦, cpd. with -pāda
(or -caraṇa), (= Pali ussaṅkha-pāda,) ep. of a mahā-
[Page118-b+ 71]
puruṣa (esp. Buddha), no. 7 of the 32 lakṣaṇa; orig. form,
etym., and mg. obscure; acc. to Pali DN comm. ii.446.28 ff.
it means that the soles of the feet can be seen as they
walk, because ‘the ankles are fixed high’; if from utsaṅga,
{%having feet characterized by a ‘lap’%} (an up-curve under the
foot, making the sole visible?). Tib. on Mvy 260 says
{%having the ankle-bone%} (or, {%joint of the ankle-bone%}) {%not visible%}
(so one Chin. version, and Jap.); but Tib. on Bbh 375.14,
cited by Wogihara, {%having feet not uneven%}; another Chin.
gloss (also cited in Mvy 260, and elsewhere, Burnouf infra)
refers the epithet to the {%knees%}; Gv 399.24 glosses suvyak-
taparamopaśobhitopari-pādacchavikusumagarbhātireka-
prabhāsvarā (not very clear or specific). These northern
interpretations make the impression of floundering in a
morass of ignorance. See Burnouf, Lotus, 573. Forms:
utsaṅga-pāda Mvy 260 (but Mironov ucchaṅkha-); LV
106.1; Dharmas 83 (v.l. utsaṅkha-); utsaṅga-caraṇa Bbh
375.14; 378.19; 379.9; 381.10; ucchaṅga-pāda LV 429.13--
14; ucchaṅkha-pāda, Mironov Mvy (see above); Mv
i.226.16; ii.29.19; 304.19 (the mss. clearly intend this all
three times! correct Senart's text); Gv 399.24 (note also
v.l. utsaṅkha- in Dharmas 83, above). This form ucchaṅkha
is closest to the Pali; the very obscurity of its etymology
may argue for its originality.
