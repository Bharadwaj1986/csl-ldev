{@? upavitarka@}¦ (m.?), in Mv ii.74.3 °keṣu vā, at the
end of a list of arts and exercises (in Mv almost wholly
martial; LV p. 156 in corresponding passage includes many
non-martial) in which the Bodhisattva challenges the
other Śākya youths; preceded by rathasmiṃ vā dhanusmiṃ
vā tharusmiṃ vā, which does not fit well with any intellec-
tual exercise ({%reasoning%} or the like) such as the apparent
etymology suggests.
