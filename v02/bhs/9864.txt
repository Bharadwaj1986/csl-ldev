{@praghātayati@}¦ (caus. to Skt. prahanti, but seems
nowhere recorded), {%causes to be killed%} (by another), so
clearly pass. praghātyate Mv i.181.3; possibly also in
Divy 10.2 praghātya (ger.), 9 °tayasi, 14 °tita, ppp. (of a
butcher or meat-dealer, perhaps {%having killed%}, but perhaps
{%killing%}, etc.); in Divy 376.21 praghātita, {%killed%}, seemingly
not caus., and prob. so praghātayitvā 530.13; praghātyate
531.9 (but this last perh. caus., {%is caused to be killed%}); MSV
i.5.2 °tayati.Cf. prec.
