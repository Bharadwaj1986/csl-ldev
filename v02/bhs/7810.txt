{@dharma-mudrā@}¦, {%‘seal’ of the doctrine%}: iya…°drā
SP 92.13 (vs); also dharma-svabhāva-mudrā, {%‘seal’ of the%}

deśem’ imāṃ °drām 47.8 (vs). Tib. renders literally, phyag
rgya, and so Burnouf, {%le sceau%}; Kern, {%closing word of my%}
{%law, fixed nature of the law, (unmistakable) stamp of the%}
{%nature of the law%}; probably the last rendering comes close
