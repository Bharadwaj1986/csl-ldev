<L>4787<pc>180,2<k1>कालवेषिन्<k2>काल-वेषिन्
[{@? kāla-veṣin@}¦, n. sg. °veṣī, said of the Bodhisattva:
LV 160.22 and 161.11 (prose), parallel and evidently
equivalent to kālākālajña or kālajña, respectively. One
ms. in 160.22 (H, generally a poor one) and three (H and
B) in 161.11 read kāla-gaveṣī, and this seems the only
possible reading: {%seeking the right occasions%}. So Tib., dus la
lta zhiṅ, {%considering%} (having regard for, caring for) {%time(s)%}.]
