{@Vinaya@}¦, m. (= Pali id.), (book of) {%discipline%}, one of
the sections of the canon: Mvy 1414 (after sūtram, abhi-
dharmaḥ); sūtra-vinayābhidharmeṇa Laṅk 290.8; Vinaye,
{%in the (text of the) V%}., Karmav 59.18; 60.9; 71.10; 158.17.
In Śikṣ 190.4, kim-ākāraṃ śrutaṃ bodhisattva-vinaye
praśastaṃ, Bendall in text and transl. understands bodhi-
sattvavinaya as n. of a work, but I believe it means merely
{%in the training of Bodhisattvas%}; there follows immediately
a citation from the {@Akṣayamati-sūtra@}. See next items.
