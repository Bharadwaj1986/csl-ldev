both are very common in prose as well as vss), ({@1@}) {%heretic%};
like its relatives, pejoratively used; there is one seeming
exception, tīrthikā vā bhavanti bhavasūdanāḥ Mv i.106.8
(vs), where if the text is correct it seems to be said of
Bodhisattvas in the 8th bhūmi that they {%become religious%}
{%prophets%} (or the like), {%destroying%} (the states of normal)
{%existence%}. I suspect a corruption, and cannot explain the
text as it stands any more than Senart (his doubtful
suggestion based on LV Calc. 313.19 falls now with the
reading of that text, which in Lefm. 250.1 is replaced
by…tīrthyāḥ, {%heretics%}, kurvante). However, it is barely
possible that this one Mv passage preserves the original
neutral mg., {%adherent%} (or {%founder%}) {%of%} (any) {%religion%}. A
trace of this may also remain in the not infrequent pre-
fixation of anya- to t°, {%other%} (than Buddhist) {%sectarian%},
LV 268.12; Mv iii.49.12 (anyatīrthikapūrvo, {%formerly a%}
{%member of another sect%}); 412.7; or {@para-t°@}, q.v.; cf. kutīr-
thikā(ḥ) LV 12.10, {%members of base%} (heretical) {%sects%}. Other-
wise, and very often, tīrthika alone means {%heretic%} simply:

ii.135.12; iii.392.7 (śramaṇa-brāhmaṇa-tīrthika-gaṇikā,
apparently implying that brahmans were not included
among tīrthikas; this cpd. appears in some of the other
passages listed); Mvy 3514; Divy 146.19; 152.5; 275.9;
Av i.2.6; 16.3 etc., common; Bhad 52; Bbh 173.11 etc.;
