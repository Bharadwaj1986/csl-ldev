{@? dvipari@}¦ (-vartanāveṇī), LV 256.1. If we accept dvi-
pari- with all mss. and both edd. we should have to under-
stand it as part of the foll. cpd.; in that case apparently
parivartanā = vartanā, and with preceding dvi- the whole
might mean {%string of double beads%} (lit. {%spheres?%}), i.e.,
[Page274-b+ 71]
possibly, extra-large ones? See the whole passage cited
s.v. {@vartanā(veṇī)@}. Note however that the close parallel
LV 254.13 lacks dvipari; and Tib. on 256.1 has nothing
corresponding. Note also that the preceding comparison,
ending pārśve (and cited l.c.), lacks any statement of the
tertium comparationis between the Bodhisattva's sides
(pārśve) and the ‘ribs’ of a crab or the roof-frame of a
(ruined) stable; 254.10--11 shows the point, viz. that they
were ‘open’, so that light shone thru. Is it possible that
dvipari goes with the preceding and contains a corruption
of some form of vi-var-(cf. vivṛtāyāṃ 254.10)? Something
like opt. vivare(t), vivari? The passage is prose, and
MIndic forms are not normal in prose of LV; but no one
knows how MIndic its original form may have been.
