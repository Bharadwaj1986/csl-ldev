{@ayuta@}¦, nt. (m. in Skt. only Mbh. Crit. ed. 3.21.24;
in BHS noted as m. Mvy 7998), in Skt. only defined as
10,000; so also Mvy 8054 = Tib. khri; but oftener = 100
koṭis or 1,000,000,000 = Tib. ther ḥbum, so defined LV
147.20 (cited Mvy 7955), also Mvy 7998, and presumably
also 7701, 7827 (in these at least higher than koṭi, and
between this and niyuta); in Sukh 31.1 a very much
higher number, listed between nayuta and akṣobhya.
