{@moṣa-dharma@}¦, adj. or subst. (Bhvr. or Karmadh.?
= Pali mosa-dhamma, by ‘false’ Sktism; Pali mosa is
quasi-vṛddhi formation to Pali musā = Skt. mṛṣā; § 3.68),
{%(of) deceptive quality%}: Śikṣ 261.8 evaṃ cakṣuś cendriyaṃ
ca rikte muṣṭisadṛśam (but prob. read rikta-muṣṭi°, see
{@muṣṭi@} 3)…tucchaṃ mṛṣā-moṣadharme (dual? {%two%}
{%things that have%}, or {%are, false and delusive qualities?%} but
all other epithets except the very doubtful rikte are sg.!)
bālopalāpanaṃ…; Dbh 43.6 (sarvasaṃskṛtaṃ) riktaṃ
tucchaṃ mṛṣā-moṣadharmā-visaṃvādakaṃ (so text; note
suggests °dharmaṃ vi°; possibly °dharmā, pl., though
subject is sg., {%false and deceptive qualities%} or {%states?%})
bālālāpanam (read bālollāp°); note that once in Pali,
AN v.84.24--25, musā immediately precedes mosadhammā
(kāmā…tucchā musā mosa°, so printed), and should
perhaps be regarded as cpd. with it. See next.
