<L>3347<pc>122,1<k1>उत्क्षेपलिपि<k2>उत्क्षेप-लिपि
{@utkṣepa-lipi@}¦, n. of a kind of script: LV 126.5; fol-
lowed by {@nikṣepa°, vikṣepa°@}, and (6) {@prakṣepa-lipi@};
also, line 7, utkṣepāvarta-lipi, and (in some mss., supported
by Tib.) nikṣepāvarta-lipi.All these terms seem to be
intended to refer to the shape of the letters, rather than
to the countries where they are used. It is hardly possible
to guess what the author meant by them, and the woodenly
literal Tib. translations give little help; Tib. renders
utkṣepa, gdeg pa, {%elevation%} (and āvarta, skor ba, {%turn%});
nikṣepa, bzhag pa or bzhog pa, {%putting down%}; vikṣepa
(which Tib. transposes to the point in line 6 where Lefm.'s
[Page122-b+ 71]
ms. A has it), rnam ḥthor, {%scattering%}; prakṣepa, bsnan pa,
{%addition, increase%}.
