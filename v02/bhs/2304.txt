{@a-vyābadhya@}¦ or {@°vadhya@}, adj. and nt. subst. (see
next, and cf. Pali avyāpajjha, as mentioned there), ({@1@})
adj., {%that cannot be injured%} or {%disturbed, inviolable%}: Mv
ii.259.15 °dhyaṃ (ms.)…dharmaṃ deśayiṣyati; 279.9
°dhyaṃ arthaṃ prārthayamāno; in both of these spelled
avyāvadhyaṃ, and associated with asādhāraṇaṃ; ({@2@}) ap-
parently subst., {%not doing harm%} (so Tib., gnod pa mi
byed): LV 380.17 avyābadhyaṃ (Foucaux {%la mansuétude%})
sukhaṃ loke. There is a v.l., in mss. usually regarded as
the best, adhyāvadhya; one might conjecture a-vyā-
vadhya, or °bādhya, ger., {%not committing injury%}. But the
context suggests that a nom. sg. noun is intended, sukhaṃ
being apparently predicate (Foucaux {%douce%}): so Tib.
takes it. In all of these forms the root vadh may have
been felt to be concerned; or the short a of the root may
be semi-MIndic (based on forms of bādh which are cer-
tainly commoner).
