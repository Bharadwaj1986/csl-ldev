jaḍa-eḍamūka-jātīyāḥ. Skt. lexicons seem to have ab-
stracted from this cpd. an adj. eḍa, {%deaf%}, assuming that
the cpd. means {%deaf and dumb%}; and in some late texts
(see Schmidt, Nachtr.), perhaps by direct borrowing from
lexx., this usage is actually found in literature. Did Mvy
also know this interpretation? Sheep are proverbially
stupid in other countries than India.
