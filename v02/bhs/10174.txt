{@pratisaṃśikṣati@}¦, only in Mv, otherwise {@°te@}, (corresp.
to Pali paṭisaṃcikkhati, as noted by Speyer on Av ii.189.8
below; under this PTSD cites Mv ii.314.15 as pratisaṃ-
cikṣati!), {%(learns exactly,) realizes perfectly, becomes well%}
{%aware that…%}, always foll. by direct quotation of the
subject's thoughts: imaṃ (v.l. idaṃ) °ti Mv ii.314.15; °te,
prec. usually by idaṃ, Av ii.189.8 (parallel in Pali, as
above, MN i.499.10, 25); Bbh 190.11; 191.3, 18, 25 (in
last three printed prati śikṣ°); or by evaṃ, Śikṣ 232.8;
Dbh 26.14, or itaḥ, Śikṣ 167.15; Laṅk 123.13 (the thought
here quoted is tat satyaṃ…asaṃbhavo; what then
follows depends on {@prativipaśyati@}, q.v., which seems to
be a synonym of this, peculiar to Laṅk); idaṃ °kṣitavyam
Av ii.107.9.
