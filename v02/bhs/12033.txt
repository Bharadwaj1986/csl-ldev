{@māla@}¦, ({@1@} = Skt. mālā, {%garland%}, as prior member
of cpd., so also in Skt., see BR: samantajvālā-māla-parye-
ṣitām (Tārām) Mmk 65.14;) ({@2@}) = {@māḍa@}, {%hall, pavilion%},
[Page431-b+ 71]
in {@maṇḍala-māḍa, °māla@}, q.v. Perhaps this same word
is to be recognized in the Bhvr. cpd. candana-māla,
{%having halls of sandalwood%}, ep. of prāsāda, {%palace%}, in Divy
43.1, 7; 49.27 ff., and of a vihāra in Karmav 64.1. But
Lévi in his note ad loc. identifies ({@3@}) -māla here with
{@mālā@}, q.v., and supports his theory with the cpd. {@mālā-@}
{@vihāra@}, q.v.; he may be right (in that case, {%having tops%}
or {%crowning pavilions of sandālwood%}); the matter seems
to me doubtful.
