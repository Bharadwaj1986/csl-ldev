{@kaṭacchu@}¦, m. or f., {@°chuka@} (once nt.) and {@°chukā@} (?),
also {@°cha@} and {@°chaka@} (app. = Pali kaṭacchu, {%spoon,%}
{%ladle%}; cf. Deśīn. 2.7 kaḍacchū, comm. ayodarvī), in most
occurrences could be either {%spoon%} or {%bowl%}; it seems that
Tib. and Chin. sources support mg. {%bowl, vessel%}; so Mvy
9013 kaṭacchuḥ, Tib. nal ze, which I do not find in Dictt.,
but nal may be connected with na li, {%bowl, basin%} (of iron
or china, Jä.), while Chin. gives (1) {%pillow%} (often made
of porcelain), or (2) {%bowl, basin%}; on Suv 86.3 and Mmk
65.2 Tib. is cited as snod, {%vessel%} (Mmk ap. Lalou, Icono-
graphic, p. 84, line 11, who nevertheless translates {%cuiller%},
pp. 37, 44); in favor of mg. {%spoon%} may be cited (besides
the Pali and Deśī words) Megh 310.10 sapta-dhūpa-
kaṭacchukām utkṣiped ākāśe (hardly {%bowlful!%} if text is
right acc. sg. f., but perhaps this represents °kān, acc.
pl. m.); most commonly in cpds. preceded by dhūpa-,
{%incense-spoon (? -bowl)%}, generally as held in the hand by
a painted image, dhūpa-kaṭacchuka-vyagra-hasta Mmk
65.2; 69.12, etc.; 322.25 (here °kaṭacchaka°); eka-dhūpa-
kaṭacchu-hasta-parigṛhītān Suv 86.3; dhūpa-kaṭacchukam
ādāya Divy 398.28--29; (dakṣiṇahaste) dhūpa-kaṭacchu-
kaṃ (n. sg. nt.!) kartavyaṃ Kv 74.20; dhūpa-°ke dhūpaś
copasthāpayitavyaḥ MSV iii.97.16; in Divy 165.18 acc.
to Index {%vessel%}, but this seems less than certain, (Pūra-
ṇaṃ, q.v., dharmaśāṭapraticchannaṃ) kaṭaccha-vrata-
bhojanam (might mean {%eating according to a vow of spoon-%}
{%fuls%}, i.e. of limiting his food to a definite number of them,
rather than {%eating by a vow of the begging-bowl%}). In Divy
475.21 kāṇḍa-kaṭacchu-pūra-kūrca-bhaiṣajya-sthavikāś is
obscure to me at more than one point; the cpd. evidently
lists articles pertaining to children, and either {%spoon%} or
{%bowl%} is conceivable.
