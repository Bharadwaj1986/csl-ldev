{@pratyavasthāna@}¦, nt. (cf. AMg. paccavatthāṇa,
{%‘clearing of a doubt’%}; M. id., {%refutation%}), in Mvy 6507 is
defined in Tib. and Chin. as ({@1@}) {%rejection; getting rid of%}
(Tib. phyir gzhil ba), or ({@2@}) {%arrangement, establishment%}
(Tib. so sor, {%severally%}, gzhag pa, {%arranging%}). Both mgs.
are supported by forms or derivs. of Skt. praty-ava-sthā-,
see pw. The word has been noted elsewhere only in Laṅk,
where it usually, and I think always, has the second mg.,
{%establishment%} (of an intellectual truth or argument):
tattva-pra°-kathā 77.7; pramāṇatrayāvayava-pra° 92.18;
pra°-gati-svabhāva-93.11; siddhānta-pra° 172.6; svanaya-
pra° 179.12 (°na-kathāṃ cintayan, {%thinking on a discourse%}
{%for establishment of his own philosophic method%}; here only,
Suzuki assumes mg. 1, {%rejection%}, but certainly wrongly);
also svanaya-pra° 193.12; 230.14, 15; -jñānādhigama-
pra° 194.18.
