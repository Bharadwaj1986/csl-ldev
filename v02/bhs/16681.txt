{@sāntarottara@}¦, nt. (= Pali santaruttara), {%the two inner%}
{%garments%} (antarvāsas and uttarāsaṅga, both Skt.) worn
by monks, to accept more than which is a naiḥsargika
pāyattika offense under the circumstances of the 7th nai°
pāy° (cf. Pali Vin. iii.214.20): Mvy 8391; MSV ii.48.15
(Corr.). As adj., possibly read sāntarottara(paṭikā-) for
sāntarocchada° Śikṣ 208.11; see s.v. {@ucchada@} (2). A monk
is forbidden to wear only these two (and discard the
{@saṃghāṭī@}): MSV ii.94.8 (cf. Vin. i.298.5).
