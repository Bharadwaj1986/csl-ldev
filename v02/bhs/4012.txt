{@ṛlla@}¦, m. (cf. next), something like {%prize-fighter%}: naṭa-
nartaka-ṛlla-malla- etc. Mv i.231.12, and in similar cpds.
Mv i.259.5; ii.100.10; 150.4; 153.17; 156.9; iii.57.9; 113.3;
141.17; 161.3; 255.11; 266.5; 442.9. Senart on i.231.12,
note, was inclined to think the word a graphic error for
jhalla, as was Burnouf (see next); but he kept the mss.
reading, which seems too common to emend.
