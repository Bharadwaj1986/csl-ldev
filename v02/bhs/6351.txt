{@? cedācitta@}¦, instr. cedācittena LV 431.12 (prose; so
only one ms.; v.l., two mss., °cintena; all other mss. and
Calc. have a haplographic omission here), is uninterpretable
to me; I must assume a corruption, perhaps a misprint.
Not noted by Weller. Foucaux's Tib. omits the passage.
(The particle ced can, it seems, hardly be involved.)
