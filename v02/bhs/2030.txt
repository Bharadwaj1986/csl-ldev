{@avakāra@}¦, m. ({@1@}) see {@avakara; (2)@} okāraṃ acc. sg.
(= Pali okāra, in phrase kāmānaṃ ādīnavo okāro saṃ-
kileso; cf. Pali anavakāra), perhaps {%elimination, getting rid%}
(sc. of desires): Mv iii.357.13 kāmeṣu bhayaṃ okāraṃ
(mss. okara-) saṃkileśaṃ, {%in regard to desires%} (he preached)
{%the danger of them, the elimination of them, their impurity%}.
Senart's em. seems confirmed by the Pali.
