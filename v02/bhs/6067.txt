{@catuṣkumbhikā@}¦ (cf. Pali catu-kuṇḍika, adj., {%going%}
{%on all fours%}; explained Pv. comm. 181.9; this and the BHS
form are certainly based on a common orig., one or the
other, or both, being modified by some analogical or
blending influence), {%way of crawling on all fours%}: °kayā
sarpati Mvy 9311; so Tib. rkaṅ lag bzhis phye ba (with
varr.), {%crawling by the four feet-and-hands%}.
