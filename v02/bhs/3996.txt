{@ṛṭ-iti@}¦ (also {@ṛg-, rig-iti@}, qq.v.), {%instantly%}: Mvy 8224
(also in Mironov); Dbh.g. 51(77).27, repeated 52(78).2
18; the same line repeated with sapadi instead of ṛṭ-iti
52(78).6, 10, 14. But for the repeated occurrence one
might suspect a merely graphic corruption for Skt. jhaṭ-
iti (var. jhag-iti).
