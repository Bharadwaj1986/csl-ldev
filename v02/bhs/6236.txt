{@cita@}¦ (orig. ppp. of Skt. ci-), orig. {%piled up, heaped%}
{%up%}; so, {%thick, dense%} (of hair), {%stout, large%} (of fingers), {%full,%}
{%stout%} (of the space between the shoulders), in cpds. ({@1@})
cita-keśa, {%having thick, dense hair%}, one of the {@anuvyañ-@}
{@jana@} of the Buddha: Mvy 343 = Tib. stug pa, {%dense,%}
{%thick%}; Mv ii.44.10, so read with one ms., the other vivitra°
(Senart em. citra°); instead Dharmas 84 has citra-keśa,
which I believe is certainly a corruption; lacking in the
LV list; ({@2@}) citāṅguli, {%with stout, large fingers%}, another
{@anuvyañjana:@} Mvy 274 (here Tib. rgyas = {%large%}); con-
firmed by Pali acc. to Burnouf, Lotus, 585; this time the
corruption citrā° (above) is more widespread, being printed
in Mv ii.43.9 (only one ms., lacuna in the other); Dharmas
84 (but one ms. ciṃtā°); and LV 106.12--13 (Lefm. anu-
pūrvacitrāṅguliś ca, combining this with anupūrvāṅguli;
most mss. have the reverse order, as does Tib., which also
renders by rgyas pa = {%large%}, proving that it had citā°
[Page229-b+ 71]
and not citrā°); ({@3@}) citāntarāṃsa (or °śa) (= Pali citan-
taraṃsa, e.g. DN ii.18.10; comm. ii.449.6 antaraṃsaṃ
vuccati dvinnaṃ koṭṭhāsānaṃ antaraṃ; taṃ citaṃ pari-
puṇṇaṃ assā ti), {%with full, well filled-in, space between the%}
{%shoulders%}, one of the 32 {@lakṣaṇa:@} Mvy 251, Tib. thal
goṅ rgyas pa = {%large shoulders%}; so also Tib. on LV 105.18;
all lists of the {@lakṣaṇa@} (q.v.) intend the same form, only
varying between °āṃsa and °āṃśa. In Gv 69.26 read
citta with 2d ed. for cita; see s.v. {@avabhā@}. See also next.
