{@abhiramya@}¦ (Pali allegedly abhiramma, Maung Tin,
see CPD; Ap. ahiramma, Jacobi, Bhav.; see {@an-, nir-@}
{@abhi°@}), {%pleasing%}: LV 187.10--11 sarvamanāpāni copa-
saṃhartavyāni viṣayābhiramyāṇi; Tib. yul ñams dgaḥ
ba thams cad ni sbyor cig, apparently making viṣaya
(yul) subject of upasaṃhartavyāni, and not translating
abhi°. The sense must apparently be {%all-mind-charming%}
{%and pleasing objects of sense are to be collected%} (prepared,
for the prince to enjoy); yathābhiramyam (= Pali yathā-
bhirantam), adv., {%as long as is agreeable%}: MSV ii.87.19.
