{@Udāyin@}¦ (or Udayin? below), {@(1) = Kālodāyin@} (also
appears as °dayin), q.v. (in Pali he is also called Udāyī):
Mvy 1056, in text (also Mironov) printed Udayī, but
Index Udāyin; Mv ii.234.8; iii.91.8; 93.3; LV 121.1 (son
of the purohita Udayana); ({@2@}) one of the {@ṣaḍvārgika@}
monks: Mvy 9476. (Tho not named in Pali as one of the
Chabbaggiya monks, 2. Udāyī in DPPN seems to have
had a character deserving this reproach and is doubtless
the same person as ours.) Named Divy 543.24 as type of
a monk who might commit a sin; subjected to {@parivāsa@}
and succeeding penances, MSV iii.32.14 ff. (in Divy and
MSV not identified with the ṣaḍvārgika); ({@3@}) n. of a son
of Ajātaśatru and ancestor of Aśoka (= Pali Udāyi-
bhadda): Divy 369.10; in the same line called, acc. to
text, {@Udayibhadra@}; MSV ii.42.11 ff.
