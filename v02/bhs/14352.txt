{@Vīṇaka@}¦, Mmk 232.10 (vs); {@Vīṇātṛtīyaka@}, Mmk 19.13
(prose); {@Vīṇādvitīyaka@}, Mmk 43.19 (prose); all nom. pl.
m.; names or epithets of a class of minor godlings; pre-
sumably the same class, since the accompanying items in
the lists where these are found are very similar (see s.v.
{@karoṭa-pāṇi@}); presumably all mean something like {%lute-%}
{%bearers%} (cf. gandharvas ?), but I have no further infor-
mation; especially -tṛtīyaka is puzzling.
