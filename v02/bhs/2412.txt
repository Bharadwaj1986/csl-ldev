{@asaṃjñi-sattva@}¦ (= Pali asañña-satta), {%having a%}
{%nature that is free from consciousness%}, or acc. to CPD
{%Unconscious Beings%}, n. of a class of gods (see s.v. {@deva@}),
one (in Dharmas and LV the 4th) of the classes of rūpā-
vacara gods of the 4th dhyāna-bhūmi (missing in the
other standard lists of gods, but required to make up the
standard count of 18 classes of gods in BHS or 16 in Pali):
Dharmas 128; LV 150.9; Divy 505.23 (see s.v. {@āsaṃjñika@});
in Mvy 2297 mentioned as an example of dwellers in the
9th and highest {@sattvāvāsa@}, but this is certainly an error;
they belong in the 5th sattvāvāsa, see this word. This is
confirmed AbhidhK. LaV-P. ii.199. f., where the name is
discussed, and it is said that they dwell in (a specially
high part of) the {@bṛhatphala@} heaven.
