{@? dārika@}¦ (= Skt. dāraka), and acc. to text °kā-
(in comp.), {%boy%}: dvātriṃśad-dārikā-sahasrāṇi LV 128.11
(prose), all mss. acc. to Lefm.; dārikebhiḥ LV 133.6 (vs),
two mss. with Calc. dāra°. There can hardly be a reference
to girls (cf. Weller 26), and at least the final -ā of dārikā
must, it seems, be a corruption for -a. Perhaps read
dāraka both times. Note the same cpd. with dāraka 128.9;
the word seems to occur only once in this passage in
Tib.
