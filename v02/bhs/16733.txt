{@Sāravatī, (1)@}¦ n. of a samādhi: Mvy 610; ŚsP 1425.5;
({@2@}) in Gv 342.2 (prose) dharmakāya-bhedya-sāravatī-
dhātu-niryātāṃ, said of a ‘night-goddess’, adept in religion.
The word sāravatī seems to qualify dhātu closely, but what
the combination means is not clear to me; {%solid element%}
or the like? Cf. Gv 350.25 niḥsattvavatī-dhātu-jñāna-
pratilabdho, said of a Bodhisattva, {%who has attained to%}
{%knowledge of the unsubstantial element(s)%}, sc. of worldly
existence; here too a fem. adj. stem qualifies dhātu in
a cpd.
