[{@abhyāyata@}¦, adj. (error for atyāyata, which is read
in other texts), in Mv ii.43.15 nābhyāyata-vacanā ca,
one (No. 47) of the {@anuvyañjana@} (q.v.). For °vacana the
orig. certainly had °vadana (so Mvy 314 etc., and Pali
āyata-vadana, Burnouf, Lotus 589); yet other versions
show the same substitution, and LV 106.16 has a further
rationalizing change, to be read with v.l. noccaśabdavacana
(for Lefm. noccavacanaśabda). The orig. = {%with not too%}
{%long face%} or the like.]
