{@rocana-piśācakā@}¦, v.l. {@°piśācanakā@} (nom. pl.; Sen.
em. °piśācikā), some sort of product of the art of the
{@śaṅkha-valaya-kāra@}; the adjoining words in Mv ii.473.11
suggest that it is a small article made of ivory, perh. for
holding unguents or the like (and made in the shape of
a piśācī? so Senart suggests).
