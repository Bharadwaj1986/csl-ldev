({@māṣa-rāśi-varṇa@}¦, adj., {%having the color of a heap of%}
{%beans%}, i.e. black and gray spotted: Mv ii.432.16, 19, etc.,
often in description of {@Kuśa@} (2); regularly preceded by
kāla, {%black%}. So the mss. invariably; they are proved right
(against Senart's em. maṣi-rāśi°) by Mbh. Cr. ed. 3.268.34
māṣarāśi-saḍṛśair…kṣaṇadācaraiḥ; the adj. fits rākṣasas
as well as Kuśa.)
