{@phala@}¦, nt. ({@1@}) (= Skt. and Pali phalaka) {%bark, bast%}
(used for garments): phala-muñjāsana-valkala…LV 249.1
(prose); ({@2@}) (= Skt. and Pali id.) {%religious fruition%} or
{%attainment%}, passim; prathama phala Mv i.174.12, 14;
[Page396-a+ 71]
192.7, 8, = the first stage of religious advancement, cf.
śrotāpattiphale i.175.1; five phalāni, sc. of karuṇā, {%com-%}
{%passion%}, acc. to Sūtrāl. xvii.31 with comm., which explains
all five, in different order: Mvy 2271-7, {@niṣyanda-, adhi-@}
{@pati-, puruṣakāra-, vipāka-, visaṃyoga-@} phalam (see
the various prior members). However, nothing is said of
karuṇā in Mvy, and it probably intends them as different
kinds of {%results%} of anything; so Bbh 102.16 ff. and AbhidhK.
LaV-P. ii.287 ff., iv.185 ff. treat the same terms.
