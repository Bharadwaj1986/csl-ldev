{@? dhaura@}¦ = (or error for?) Skt. dhaureya, in (puruṣa-
siṃhena puruṣarṣabheṇa) puruṣa-dhaureṇa (puruṣajāne-
yena, see {@-jāneya@}) Mv ii.133.8 (prose); in essentially the
same passage in which other texts read puruṣa-dhaureyeṇa,
but in Mv with v.l. °dhaureṇa, LV 350.12; Mv i.229.8;
ii.284.18. The word dhaureya, = Pali dhoreyya and
(purisa-)dhorayha, occurs occasionally in Skt., and seems
to mean primarily {%stout animal, capable of bearing burdens%},
but then secondarily {%best of his kind%} (= mukhya, Schmidt,
Nachträge). In the cliché passage just mentioned, it refers
to superior men, esp. Buddhas (used in reference to Śākya-
muni at the moment of enlightenment). In…dhīrā dhau-
reyā dhṛtimanto…, in the midst of a long description
of the inhabitants of Sukhāvatī, Sukh 61.6 (prose); in
Mv ii.364.16 (vs), of a man who worships at stūpas,
dṛḍhavīryo dṛḍhasthāmo dhaureyo (replaced by vīraś ca
in citation Śikṣ 299.3) dṛḍhavikramo. In all these it is not
entirely clear how definite the lit. mg., {%stout animal%},
remained. In any case (puruṣa-)dhaureya seems pretty
well established as standard Skt.; and I suspect that
dhaura is a mere error.
