{@mukhara@}¦, adj. (in Skt. {%noisy%}, esp. {%garrulous%}, but also
of animals and inanimate objects; Lex. as subst. {%a crow%},
and acc. to MW as adj. {%scurrilous%}, a mg. which the word
is said to have in Pali), perh. {%impudent%} (in action, by

[Page434-a+ 71]
iii.127.15 said of a crow which kept snatching food from
a king's servants, eṣo kākaḥ dhṛṣṭo mukharo pragal-
bho…; the regular Skt. mg. seems impossible here, since
the complaint was not against the crow's noise but his
impudent behavior. Cf. {@amukhara@}.
