{@? cārayin@}¦, adj. ? (to cārayati, caus. of car-; if adj.
form, contains suffix -in), {%propagating, spreading%} (heretical
views): vakṣyanty avarṇam asmākaṃ tīrthyavādaṃ ca
cārayī (v.l. °yi) SP 273.3 (vs); Kashgar rec. tīrthikā vāca
cārayī, which seems better in eliminating the super-
fluous and disturbing ca; but the form cārayī could not
only be n. pl. of an in-stem adj., but also ger. (note v.l.
°yi, also ambiguous). WT kārayī with ms. Ḱ.
