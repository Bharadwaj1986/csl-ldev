{@atyudgacchati@}¦, and ppp. {@atyudgata@}, sometimes in
texts and oftener in mss. (frequently as v.l.) for {@abhyud°@}
in meaning {%rises%} (ppp. {%risen%}) {%above%}. Graphic confusion is
certainly concerned here, at least in part; except as under
{@atyudgata@}, q.v., all occurrences are grouped under
{@abhyud°@}, q.v. For the most part Pali abbhuggacchati and
derivatives support this classification. Note however
(aside from Pali accuggata, apparently only used as adjec-
tive, often with specialized meanings) Pali accuggamma,
ger., used of water-plants, {%having grown out above%} (the
water, acc. or abl.); but BHS uses (only) abhyudgacchati
in this sense, according to unanimous tradition, tho
perhaps this tradition may be erroneous. Contrariwise,
there is even in Pali tradition some confusion between
abbhugg- and accugg- in this group; see CPD s.v. abbhug-
gata (a var. accuggata occurs with subject yaso).
