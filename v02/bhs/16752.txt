{@sālambha@}¦, m. (may be specialized use of {@sārambha@}
= Pali id., which so far as I know is not recorded of phy-
sical fighting; in some LV mss. v.l. sār° occurs sometimes
for this), app. {%(contest of) wrestling%}: °bhaḥ Mvy 4998 =
Tib. gyad kyi ḥdzin staṅs, lit. {%an athlete's style%} (or {%posture%})
{%of grasping%}, Das = saṃgrāho mallasya, saṃlambha (! not
recorded elsewhere; prob. Das's ‘correction’ for sāl°), {%‘the%}
{%mode of seizing in wrestling’%}: (in lists of arts) asi-dhanu(ṣ)-
kalāpa-yuddha-sālambha- LV 4.21; 143.6; 144.8; in all
these Tib. as on Mvy above, and so also for °bha-(dhanur-
vede) LV 156.9; that {%wrestling%} is meant seems confirmed
by LV 152.10 ff., in which the Bodhisattva defeats the
Śākya youths in what can only be {%wrestling%} (cf. esp.
152.18--20); our word occurs there several times, Śākyaku-
mārāḥ sālambhāya sthitāḥ 152.11, {%stood ready for wrestling%};
similarly abhigatau °bhāya 12; °bhāyāgacchata 22; here,
[Page594-a+ 71]
however, Tib. renders always by brgal ba (once preceded
by stobs, {%force%}), a general word for {%fight%}.
