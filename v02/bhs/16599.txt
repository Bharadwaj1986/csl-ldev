{@sahāya@}¦, in LV 387.9 (vs), if text is right must mean
{%accompanied%} (by, with instr.): adhunāpy asau tāṃ…
saṃpūjayaty anyasuraiḥ sahāyaḥ, {%even now he honors it,%}
[Page588-b+ 71]
{%together with the other gods%}. But this use of sahāya seems
unparalleled, and Tib. makes it agree with anyasuraiḥ:
lha gzhan grogs daṅ lhan cig mchod pa byed, {%honors it%}
{%together with the other companion gods%}; this implies sahāyaiḥ,
which is prob. the true reading, tho no v.l. is cited. Cf.
however {@sahīya@}, Buddhac. x.26.
