[{@paṭipākaroti@}¦, so mss. for {@paṭijāgareti@}, q.v.; or in
Mv iii.161.7 mss. paṭiyākṛtaṃ (y could be graphic error
for p). While Senart's em. seems probably right, we must
note Pali paṭipākatika, also simply pākatika, {%set right,%}
{%fixed up%}, or the like; esp. {%restored to normal%} or {%desirable%}
{%condition%}; formally, the mss. forms of Mv could be related
to the Pali paṭi-pā°, retaining partially MIndic phonology;
Skt. would require prati-prākaroti, or °pra°.]
