{@Vaihāya@}¦, acc. to all mss, Mv i.70.16 (parvatasya
vaihāya-varasya, vs), kept by Senart, = Skt. Vaibhāra
(or Vaihāra, once Mbh.), n. of a mountain outside Rājagṛha.
In Pali and AMg. the only form recorded is Vebhāra.
See Senart's note ad loc.; he assumes Prakritic y for r,
but Geiger 46.3, Pischel 255 make the interchange of y
and r seem doubtful. Could this form be influenced by
vaihāyasa, etc. (by popular etymology)?
