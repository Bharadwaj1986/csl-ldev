{@kṣaṇa@}¦, m. (= Pali khaṇa), {%birth under favorable%}
{%conditions%}. There are 8 {@akṣaṇa@} (q.v.) but only 1 kṣaṇa,
viz., birth as a man in the ‘middle region’, where a Buddha
is to be expected, at a time when he is born, and with the
mental capacity to assimilate his doctrine (Pali AN iv.227.8
ff.): Mv ii.363.4 kṣaṇaṃ (acc.) ekaṃ buddhotpādaṃ suśo-
bhanam; Suv 41.(13--)14(--15) (bhavantu aṣṭākṣaṇavīti-
vṛttāḥ, so read) āsādayantu kṣaṇarājam ({%the supreme%}
{%favorable birth%}) uttamaṃ, (labhantu buddhehi samāgamaṃ
sadā); Śikṣ 2.4; 114.15 kṣaṇasampad, {%the good luck of%}
(this) {%favorable birth%}; 282.1 kṣaṇa-gati-pratilabdhena {%having%}
{%obtained the lot of…%}; Kv 18.19 sarvakṣaṇopapannāḥ
sattvā(ḥ), {%all creatures born under%} (the described) {%favorable%}
{%conditions%}, cf. Sūtrāl. xiii.10 kṣaṇopapatti.(In Mv ii.378.1
Senart kṣaṇāṃś ca, but keep kṣaṇāc ca with mss., {%and%}
{%instantly%}.) Once, however, kṣaṇa in this sense seems to be
[Page198-b+ 71]
pluralized: Mv ii.392.5--6 so akṣaṇāni parivarjayitvā,
kṣaṇā ca tasya bhavanti viśiṣṭā (but mss. bhavati viśiṣṭo,
taking kṣaṇā as n. sg., § 8.24); the same vs Śikṣ 306.1
even makes 8 kṣaṇa, obviously as mechanical pendant
to the 8 akṣaṇa; so akṣaṇaṃ vai vijahāti sarvaṃ, aṣṭakṣa-
ṇāś cāsya viśiṣṭa bhonti.This is a secondary distortion.
In LV 327.12 dullabho 'dya labhitaḥ kṣaṇavaro amṛto,
{%today has been obtained the immortal%} (nectar-like?) {%excellent%}
{%favorable birth that is hard to obtain%}, followed by 13…
varjitā (a)kṣaṇaduḥkhā asurasurapure, {%avoided the pains%}
{%of unfavorable births in the cities of asuras and gods%}; evidently
both kṣaṇa and akṣaṇa (the latter includes birth as a god!)
are used in their standard meanings; but here the use of
kṣaṇa is not strictly logical, since the Bodhisattva himself
is speaking! [In Divy 76.25; 465.23 read {@kṣūṇa@}, q.v.]
