{@janayati@}¦ (like {@upajanayati@}, q.v.) is used in BHS in
the mg. {%conceive%} (lit. {%produce%}) a feeling or notion, in oneself;
this seems to Senart, n. on Mv i.47.1, different enough
from Skt. usage to record: Mv i.47.1 naiva tāva janayanti
mānasaṃ agrapudgalagataṃ; SP 12.6 (vs) harṣaṃ janitvā
(metr. bad).
