2 {@cetayati@}¦ (the verb on which is based Pali caus.
cetāpeti, below), {%buys%}: cetayitvā, ger., Prāt 492.13; 493.2,
4, 9 etc., see {@cetanaka@}. In Lang. 22.98 it was stated
that the subject of Pali cetāpeti, {%causes to be bought, has%}
{%bought%}, ‘is always a monk or nun, who instigates (a layman)
to buy (something for himself or herself).’ This is true
only in Vin. iv.250.14--15; in Vin. iii.216.13 and 237.10
the subject is a layman, tho the mg. is certainly {%causes to%}
{%be bought, has bought%} (for the benefit of a monk). Vin.
iii.216.13 is the same passage as Prāt 492.13 (see {@cetanaka@})
where cetayitvā, {%having bought%}, replaces Pali cetāpetvā,
{%having had%} (ordered) {%bought%} (for a monk). The non-caus.
form of Prāt proves the meaning of the caus. Pali form,
which Pali interpreters have not understood. The former
is not recorded in Pali, nor the latter in BHS. The etymology
is unknown but the mg. is clear from the contexts.
