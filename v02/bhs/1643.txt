{@abhiṣakta@}¦, adj. (ppp. of Skt. abhi-ṣajati, Pali abhisa-
jati, both {%offend, give offense to; afflict%}; cf. {@abhiṣajyate@};
wrongly defined in BR s.v. sañj with abhi; Mbh. Crit. ed.
3.30.26 [Nīl. tāpito, tāpayet for abhiṣakto, abhiṣajet] and
4.4.9 [Rāmakṛṣṇa paraphrases using abhiṣaṅga, glossed
parābhava], which are the only two passages cited in BR;
pw adds one other from Caraka, abhiṣakta, defined cor-
rectly {%heimgesucht%}), ({@1@}) lit. {%offended%}, hence {%angered, wrath-%}
{%ful%} (so the cognate Pali abhisaṅgin is used; Pali abhisatta,
in most occurrences, = Skt. abhiśapta {%cursed%}, but see
below), always followed by synonyms kupita, caṇḍībhūta
(or in Prāt caṇḍīkṛta): Divy 622.11; Karmav 26.5 (here
krodhābhiṣakta); 27.13; Prāt 500.8; 512.9 et alibi; ({@2@}) in
Mvy 2965 abhiṣaktaḥ defined by Tib. (ṅan ba) and Chin.
as simply {%bad, wicked%}; the Jap. has three alternative
renderings, all obviously based on etymological guesswork;
one means {%vituperated%}. Occurs in a section entitled krodha-
kārāḥ, and containing mostly words for {%anger, angry%} etc.,
and perhaps to be interpreted precisely in this sense; in
that case belonging with (1). However, Pali abhisatta-
rūpa occurs once (Vv.chap. 84 vs. 5; p. 78 line 8) as ep.
of bhūmippadesa, a {%region%}, described as desolate, barren
wilderness; the comm. and modern interpreters take it
as meaning {%accursed%}, identifying it with the usual Pali
abhisatta (= °śapta, above); but the Vv.context contains
no evidence for this; possibly it = Skt. abhiṣakta, orig.
{%heimgesucht%} (as in Caraka, above), {%afflicted, evil%}. In that
case abhiṣakta of Mvy might mean what Tib. and Chin.
say, simply {%wicked%}, which would be not a difficult develop-
ment from {%afflicted%}.
