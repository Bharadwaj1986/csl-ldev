{@ājanya@}¦, also {@ājaniya, ājānya, ājāniya, ājāneya@},
adj. (= Pali ājañña, ājāniya, ājānīya, ājāneyya), {%of noble%}
{%race, blooded%}, primarily of animals, esp. horses; by extension
used of men, esp. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and very
rarely (meaning {%noble%}) of other, inanimate entities. Tib.
(e.g. Mvy 1080, 4769, etc.) regularly renders caṅ śes (pa),
{%omniscient%}, falsely interpreting the word as derived from
jñā {%know%}. In composition, the word in all its forms regu-
larly (not always) follows the noun, e.g. aśvājāneya, {%a%}
{%blooded horse%} (orig. perhaps {%a thoroughbred of a horse?%}),
below. As separate word: of animals, yo aśvavaraṃ
damayed ājāneyan (= °yaṃ) va saindhavaṃ Ud xix.7;
ājāneyā hayottamāḥ Mv ii.487.20; iii.22.11; cf. yuktāni
ājānyarathāni Mv iii.441.10 {%chariots of%} (drawn by) {%blooded%}
(horses), {%all hitched up%}; ājāneyau dvau balīvardhāv LV
381.7; ājăniyo hastipoto Mv iii.130.7 (prose, no v.l.); of
men, ājāneyānāṃ sattvānāṃ Gv 322.8; °neyaḥ Mvy 1080,
of śrāvakas; °neya ity ucyate LV 425.19, of the Tathāgata;
ājāneyo kahin ti nāma (so Senart em., mss. kāma) bhoti
Mv iii.397.14, answered by…ājāneyo (v.l. °ya) tam
(Senart em. ti tam) āhu bhūriprajñā (mss. °jño) 398.12;
voc. ājanya, addressed to Buddha, namas te muktā-
yājanya Mmk 4.22; cf. Divy 617.16 ājāneya-mānā, {%paying%}
{%reverence to the Noble One%} (the Buddha); in KP 9.5 and
10.5 dāntājāneya-prāpta; 9.14; 10.17 and 20 ājanya-
prāpta, all of Bodhisattvas (cf. 10.1 ājāneyā bodhisattvāḥ),
{%become noble%} (steeds), see s.v. {@prāpta@}; the figure of a horse
is surely intended here, since there is contrast with KP
9.1 bodhisattva-khaḍuṅkāḥ, the latter (q.v.) being a term
pertaining in its literal sense to horses; here may also
belong Mv ii.264.14 ājāneya-vikrāntaṃ vikramantam,
said of the Bodhisattva, {%striding with the stride of a blooded%}
{%horse%}, or {%of a noble person%} (cf. the next following mahāpuru-
ṣavikrāntaṃ vikr°), but possibly {%striding with a noble%}
{%stride%} (cf. the preceding aparājitavikrāntaṃ vikr°), as in
the next example; as prior member of karmadhāraya
cpds. or bahuvrīhis based on them, occasionally {%noble,%}
{%distinguished%}, in application to other than animate beings:
catasra imā…ājāneya-gatayo bodhisattvenānugantavyāḥ
RP 14.13, {%noble procedures%} (listed as sugatipratilābha,
guruśuśrūṣaṇā, prāntaśayyāsanābhirati, pratibhānapra-
tilābha; is the literal meaning {%gaits of a blooded horse?%});
ājāneya-svaraḥ Mv iii.343.5 could, then, also be taken as
{%having a noble sound%} (ep. of the Buddha's voice), but in
view of the preceding vṛṣabhasvaraḥ and the following
krauñcasvaraḥ it probably means {%having the sound of a%}
{%blooded (horse)%} and belongs above; once, at least, this
adj. precedes in composition the name of the animal to
which it is applied, ājāneya-hasty-upetān Śikṣ 26.14;
but regularly this order is reversed (as in such cpds. as
nara-śārdūla) and we find aśvājāneya, m. (lit. {%thoroughbred%}
{%of a horse%}) Mvy 4773 (misunderstood pw s.v. ājāneya);
Divy 510.21, 22; 511.1 ff.; Mv ii.270.11 (mss.); Gv 400.13;

siṃhājāneya Mvy 4769; and (cf. above, and Pali puri-
sājāneyya) by extension puruṣājāneya (the corruptions
puruṣăjāneya and °ṣajāna occur in mss. and sometimes in
edd.) LV 350.11, corresponds to Mv i.229.8; Mv ii.133.8;
