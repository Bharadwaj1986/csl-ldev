{@prasavāyitā@}¦ (so mss.; could be denom. ppp. to Skt.
prasava), {%delivered%} (of a child): tayā ({%by her%}, the mid-
wife) sā °tā Divy 484.8 (ed. em. prasavāpitā, ppp. of
MIndic caus. to Skt. prasavati, {%bears%}); the reading of
the mss., and my interpretation, seem supported by the
close parallel tayā {@prasavitā@} 485.12, {%by her she was%}
{%delivered%}, where the form in °tā can at any rate not be
caus., and seems likely to be denom. from prasava (rather
than a MIndic ppp. to prasavati, = Skt. prasūtā).
