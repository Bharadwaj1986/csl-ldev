<L>7050<pc>257,1<k1>तेषा<k2>तेषा
{@? teṣā@}¦, acc. to Susa semi-MIndic for tṛṣṇā, {%thirst%}:
Dbh.g. 28(54).3, 11, teṣu in text, v.l. tṛṣṇā in 3, teṣa in
11. Cf. AMg. tisā, from Skt. tṛṣā (equivalent to, but not
identical with, tṛṣṇā); teṣa (better than teṣu) might
possibly be a curious substitute for that AMg. form, with
a for ā and e for i m.c., cf. § 3.60.
