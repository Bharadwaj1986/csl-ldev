{@saṃvṛti@}¦, f., ({@1@}) in the sense of {@saṃvara@} (1), noted
only Sūtrāl. iv.4 śīla-°tiḥ; ({@2@}) (= Pali saṃmuti; see also
{@sāṃvṛta@}), {%convention, general (popular) acceptance%} or
{%belief; ‘common sense’; conditioned, exoteric, dependent,%}
{%limited truth%} or {%knowledge%}, often in contrast with para-
mārtha (so also in Pali, e.g. Miln. 160.1 saṃmuti mahārāja
esā, ahan-ti mamāti, na paramattho eso); Tib. regularly
kun rdzob, {%altogether void%}; may have been etym. under-
stood sometimes as {%covering%}, but I have found no clear
evidence for this (which is Bendall and Rouse's rendering,
e.g. p. 236, on Śikṣ 256.4, 5) and believe it misleading;
Pali saṃmuti suggests the true etym. (root man); cf.
under (3) below: yāḥ kāścana saṃvṛtayo hi loke, sarvā
hi tā munir nopaiti Bbh 48.24 (vs, metr. deficient) = Pali
Sn 897, reading saṃmutiyo; defined Bbh 49.(3--)5 as {%verbal%}
{%symbols%} ({@prajñapti@} 4, q.v. for citation, as also for Śikṣ
257.7--8 where saṃvṛti = nāmadheya, saṃketa, prajñapti);

{%‘common sense’%}; °ti-jñānam Mvy 1237 (et al., see {@jñāna@}),

of four kinds of knowledge (as also in Mvy), DN iii.226,
[Page541-b+ 71]
last line, expl. comm. iii.1020.15 ff. as any other kind of
knowledge than the first three; asti saṃvṛtyā cakṣuḥ

reṇa Sukh 42.11, {%by conventional terminology%} or {%exoteric%}
(not fundamentally true) {%manner of speaking%}; saṃvṛti-
paramārthataḥ Śikṣ 2.8, {%(knowing) both as to exoteric and%}

rayāt puruṣabhrāntiḥ syād? Śikṣ 264.3 (Bendall and Rouse
completely wrong), {%how may common-sense, which is without%}
{%any sound basis, be right, and how on the other hand wrong?%}
{%As, given a post, the delusion%} (occurs) {%that it is a man. But%}
{%how, for one who believes in voidness, can in real (esoteric)%}
{%truth the post be a fact, on the basis of which the delusion%}
{%that it is a man might arise?%}; saṃvṛti-satya, {%common-sense%}
{%truth%}, contrasted with paramārtha-s°, Mvy 6545 (Tib. kun
rdzob kyi bden pa); Dharmas 95 (dve satye); Bbh 292.18
(dvividhaṃ satyam; but 17 has just said, avitathārthena
tāvad ekam eva satyaṃ, na dvitīyam asti; this, of course,
is paramārtha-s°); Bhad 6^3; the cpd. saṃmuti-sacca is
cited from a late Pali text in Childers, and from Miln.
160(.1) by PTSD, but this last is an error (does the cpd.
occur in older Pali?); saṃvṛti-saṃgha, MSV iii.116.19;
117.1, defined as one in which all members are {@pṛthagjana-@}
{@kalyāṇaka@}, q.v., and in which (117.4) it is possible that
a rite may be performed incorrectly in all innocence,
hence {%conditioned assembly%} (of monks), where intentions
are good but not necessarily results; ({@3@}) {%consent%} in the
sense of a formal vote (of the saṃgha): yāni punas tāni
(kulāni) śaikṣa-saṃvṛti-saṃmatāni…Prāt 526.3, {%families%}
{%which have been held by formal declaration to be śaikṣa%};
so Chin.; note association of saṃvṛti with saṃmata
(etym.!); samagreṇa ca bhikṣuṇīsaṃghena avandanārha-
saṃvṛtyā saṃmataḥ Bhīk 28b.4 {%and%} (an expelled monk)
{%who by the entire congregation of nuns has been judged by%}
{%formal vote that he is unworthy to be saluted%}; does Pali
saṃmuti have this mg.? for such passages as Vin. iii.199.26
bhikkhu-saṃmutiyā the Dictt. and Transl. give {%by permis-%}
{%sion of the%} (order of) {%monks%}, which here at least is possible;
this, rather than {%vote%} (but the saṃgha did in fact vote
on the question!), may be the meaning in brahmacaryopa-
sthāna-saṃvṛtiṃ yācitavyā Bhīk 17b.1, {%she must be made%}
{%to ask for permission%} (or, {%for a vote%}, sc. that she be allowed)
{%to enter the religious life%}; so, āryikā-saṃghāt °tiṃ yāce
ib. 2, (the initiate says) {%I ask%} (this) {%permission%} (or {%vote%})
{%from the assembly of venerable nuns%}. Both Prat 526.3 and
Bhīk 28b.4 associate saṃvṛti (Pali saṃmuti) with saṃ-
mata, suggesting that. °vṛti is hyper-Skt. for Pali °muti.
