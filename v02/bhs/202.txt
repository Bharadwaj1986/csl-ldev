{@acira-cira-cireṇā@}¦ (m.c. for °ṇa; no v.l.; as one word?
so text): LV 78.5 (vs). Rendered by Foucaux {%for a long%}

bhāṣato yaṃ mataṃ me; acira-cira-cireṇā jāta udyāna-
buddhiḥ,…{%for a long time I have conceived the thought of%}
(going to) {%the pleasure-park%}. Could acira(ṃ?) be taken
separately, with preceding line? Tib. seems to have nothing
for acira; it says yun riṅ riṅ po ḥdas nas, {%for a long, long%}
{%time past%}.
