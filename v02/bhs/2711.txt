Tib. bdaṅ du ḥgyur ba (or bya ba), so also Mironov;

Pali esp. used of one of three influences leading to virtue,
attādhi° (q.v. CPD), lokādhi°, dhammādhi°, see Childers

{%oneself%}, i.e. {%conscience%} or {%self-respect; the influence of the%}
{%world%} or {%public opinion; the influence of dhamma%} or {%regard%}
{%for moral principles%} as authoritatively laid down). In
BHS little evidence is found for the existence of these,
tho Speyer (Transl. 114) renders Jm 80.14 (hrīvarṇa-
pratisaṃyukteṣu) lokādhipateyeṣu ca (sc. upaneyam) by
…{%the regard of public opinion%}, perhaps rightly. On the
other hand, lokādhipateya-prāpta LV 425.5 can only
mean {%arrived at the overlordship of the world%}; it is one of
a long list of epithets of the Buddha as the one that has
‘turned the wheel of the Law’; it is preceded by lokagurur
…lokārthakara…lokānuvartaka…lokavid ity ucyate,
and it would be absurd to interpret it as {%under the control%}
{%of public opinion%}. (See also LV 179.20--21 s.v. {@ādhipate-@}
{@yatā@}.) Mv i.16.12 = 18.5, 15 = 19.5 = 20.10 (evaṃ
