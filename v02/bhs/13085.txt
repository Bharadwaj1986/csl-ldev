{@lokottara@}¦, adj. (cf. Skt. id., Pali lokuttara; cf. {@lokika,@}
{@laukika@}), {%super-worldly%}, esp. (but not invariably) said of
a Buddha and all his aspects and activities, acc. to the
{@Lokottaravādin@} school: °rasya Buddhasya Śākyamunino
Mv i.48.15; °rā(ḥ), said of Buddhas, i.96.12; (na hi kiṃcit
samyaksaṃbuddhānāṃ lokena samaṃ,) atha khalu sarvam
eva maharṣiṇāṃ lokottaraṃ i.159.3 (a summary statement
of the doctrine of the L. school); various functions of the
Buddha specifically called lok° Mv i.167.17, 18 (see s.v.
{@niṣaṇṇa@}); 168.1, 2, 3, 4, 9; in Divy 161.25 no creature
can comprehend a Buddha's lokottara-cittaṃ, but any
creature can understand his laukikaṃ (q.v.) cittaṃ (line
23); (Bodhisattvas) budhyanty āśayasaṃyuktā loke lokot-
tare tathā Mv i.86.4, {%are enlightened in regard to the world%}
{%and the supramundane%}, which I think may mean (in the
dogmatic sense) what pertains to the Buddha, tho Senart
thinks differently; °raṃ arthaṃ ({%supramundane goal%})
prārthayamāno Bodhisattvo Mv ii.279.8; °rābhiḥ kathā-
bhiḥ Sukh 59.10, see s.v. {@lokika@}; in Laṅk 156.15 (cf. 157.9,
11) jñāna, and in 237.2--3 ff. pāramitā, are of three kinds,
laukika (of worldly persons and heretics), lokottara (of
śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas), and lokottaratama (of
Bodhisattvas); here the word can hardly have its technical
dogmatic meaning.
