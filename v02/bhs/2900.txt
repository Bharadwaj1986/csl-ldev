{@ārāva@}¦, nt., a high number: Mvy 7839 = Tib. rig(s)
sdom; cited from Gv; var. {@agava@}, q.v. But Gv 133.3 reads
{@avaga@} (nt.), which has the same Tib. rendering Mvy
7713 and is probably to be read for ārāva. Mironov reads
arāvam, noting vv.ll. agavam, aravam. In Gv 105.21
replaced by {@vipāsa@}.
