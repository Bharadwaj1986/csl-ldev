{@? visāriṇī@}¦, in Divy 562.23 (prose) sa tābhyāṃ yāvat
trir apy ukto visāriṇī kṛṣṇā nivāryamāṇā (so text, em.,
mss. °ṇau, intending °ṇo, which read) nāvatiṣṭhate, {%he%}
(the king), {%tho spoken to%} (in admonition) {%by those two%}
(ministers) {%as many as three times, being held back…did%}
{%not remain%} (in good conduct; he kept backsliding into evil
ways). The words visāriṇī kṛṣṇā perhaps corruptly represent
an abl. phrase, {%from his evil course%} (cf. {@kṛṣṇa@} 1). As they
stand, they could apparently only be a strange parentheti-
cal clause; {%the corruption%} (? visāriṇī, or viśār° ?) {%was black%}
{%(dark, evil)%}. The Index to ed. renders kṛṣṇā by {%tongue of%}
{%fire%}, which seems unacceptable; presumably it takes visā°
as {%spreading%}; but even with the em. to nivāryamāṇā this
hardly gives an intelligible result.
