{@kiṃcana@}¦ (= Pali id.), prob. {%attachment, defilement%}
(see Childers and PTSD): RP 35.12 kleśābhibhūtāḥ sa-
khilāḥ sa-kiṃcanāḥ (Bhvr.). Undoubtedly sa-ki° and the
noun kiṃcana (in Pali) were abstracted from a-kiṃcana,
adj., orig. {%having nothing%}, then {%disinterested, unattached,%}
{%without attachment%} or {%defilement%}, whence finally (sa-)kiṃ-
cana, as above. In late Skt. (Schmidt, Nachtr.) sa-kiṃcana
occurs, glossed sa-dhana. In RP it could possibly mean
{%propertied, interested in wealth%}, but Pali usage is prob.
to be followed.
