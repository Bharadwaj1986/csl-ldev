{@uttarika@}¦ (Pali, see below), in Śikṣ 332.1 (vs) ăjīvika-
dharma-carāṇāṃ uttarikāṇa anuttarikāṇāṃ, {%of Ājīvika-%}
{%sectarians, superior and not superior(?)%}; acc. to Bendall
and Rouse, Transl., {%those who have or those who have not%}
{%the higher aim%}, which is hardly illuminating. See Bendall's
note in Text p. 414 for report of a Chin. interpretation, for
which I find no basis in Indic. In Pali uttarika is reported
only Nett. 50.10 °kānaṃ phalānaṃ pattiyā; obviously
{%superior%} or the like. Pali has no anuttarika.
