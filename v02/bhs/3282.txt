[{@?uccheṣṭum@}¦, v.l. ucchreṣṭum, infin., {%to send forth,%}
{%emit, hurl out%}: Divy 186.5 (nāgo 'ṅgāravarṣam) ucch°
ārabdhaḥ (against a monk). But ud plus śiṣ can hardly
have the required meaning, and the v.l., tho nonsensical,
seems to point in the right direction: read utsraṣṭum, from
ud plus sṛj (or a MIndic or false hyper-Skt. form thereof).]
