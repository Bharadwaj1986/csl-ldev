{@Śuklodana@}¦ (Pali Sukko°), n. of a brother of Śuddho-
dana: Mv i.352.13; 355.19; iii.176.14 (father of Ānanda,
Upadhāna, and Devadatta); Mvy 3600. In Mv iii.177.1,
acc. to mss., another Śuklodana, also brother of Śuddho-
dana, is named (just after iii.176.14 above), as the father
of Nandana and Nandika (v.l. Nandaka); Senart em. to
Śukrodana, referring to Kern, Der Buddhismus 310, who
alleges among Śuddhodana's brothers, besides Śuklodana,
also ‘Śukrodana or Śuklodana’. The source of Kern's
statement is not clear to me; it would have to be a northern
(Skt. or BHS) text; both forms would be Sukkodana in
MIndic. In any case I think that Mv iii.177.1 has carelessly
substituted a repetition of Śuklo° for Dhautodana of
i.352.13 and 355.20 (or Droṇodana of Mvy 3601), the
correct name of the fourth of the brothers, otherwise
missing in this passage.
