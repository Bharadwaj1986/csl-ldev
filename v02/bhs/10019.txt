({@pratipādaka@}¦, nt. (= Pali paṭi°), {%leg%} (support) {%of a%}
{%bed%}: Mvy 9044 = Tib. khri ḥu rkaṅ rten, supported by
Pali; there seems to be a Tib. var. skra ḥi, {%of hair%}, for khri
ḥu, {%of a bed%}; hence BR {%eine Schale für Haare%}, and Chin.
{%cut-hair receptacle%} (or {%instrument%}). The adjoining words in
Mvy seem to me to support the other interpretation. And in
fact Skt. has the word in this mg.; see Schmidt, Nachträge.)
