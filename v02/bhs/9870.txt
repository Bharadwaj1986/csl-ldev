{@pracārika@}¦, m. or nt., {@°kā@}, f., in pāda-pra°, {%journey%}
{%on foot%}: Mmk 694.3--4, ūṣmāyamāne pādapracārikaṃ
pañcayojanaśatāni gacchati, sarve cāsya pādapracārikā
vaśyā bhavanti, {%if it steams%}, (it augurs that) {%he is going a%}
{%journey of 500 yojanas on foot, and all foot-journeys come%}
{%under his control%}; but the mg. in the next two is obscure
to me: ūṣmāyamāne (as above!) pādapracārikāṃ (so!)
pañcavarṣasahasrāyur bhavati Mmk 713.17, and: pāda-
pracārike (! loc. sg.?) saptavarṣsahasrāṇi jīvati 718.8--9;
in both of these it seems that omens of very long life are
inferred, in the first depending on {%steaming%} of the offering;
[Page357-b+ 71]
the word pādapra° is obscure in application; perhaps read
°rikāyāṃ for °rikāṃ in 713.17, and render both words
{%in case of%} (his making) {%a foot-journey?%}
