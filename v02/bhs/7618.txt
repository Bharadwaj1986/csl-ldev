{@dvāra-koṣṭhaka@}¦, m. (= Pali °koṭṭhaka; cf. {@caraṇa-@}
{@koṣṭha@}), lit. {%gate-room%}; a room, or (often) roofed but open
space, over a gate or entrance (to a private house, religious
[Page274-a+ 71]
edifice, or city); such spaces, guarded by railings and
covered but open in front, are seen in the ‘cave-temples’
of Ajanta etc. Also, perhaps by extension, seems to be
used in the sense of {%gate, entrance%}; and sometimes it is hard
to say which is meant: °ke sthitvā Divy 17.12, {%at the gate%}
(entrance, to a house); bhagavāṃs tasya (sc. of a private
person, at his house) dvārakoṣṭhakam anuprāptaḥ; dauvā-
rikapuruṣeṇāsya niveditaṃ, bhagavān dvāre (note! =
°koṣṭhake) tiṣṭhatīti Av i.31.10, {%is standing at the gate%}; Divy
535.11 ff., here app. a city-gate; bahirdvārakoṣṭhaka (= Pali
bahidvārakoṭṭhaka), {%the space outside the gate%}: °kasyaikānte
Bhīk 3b.2 (here prob. of the vihāra-gate); jetavanaṃ
gataḥ…dvāra°ke sthitvāgaruṃ dhūpitavān Av i.24.2;
in the last it is hard to say whether the gateway, or the
space over it, is meant; app. of the space over the entrance
to a vihāra, °ke pañcagaṇḍakaṃ cakraṃ kārayitavyam
Divy 300.8, 9, 25; (stūpasya…) catvāro °kā māpitāḥ
Divy 244.17; (dvitīyamaṇḍale) °ke Mmk 47.26; others,
Jm 19.17; 20.1; MSV i.168.12 etc.
