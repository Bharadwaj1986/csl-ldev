{@ujjaṅkikā@}¦, some kind of attitude or behavior which
monks must avoid in begging food: Mvy 8546 nojjaṅki-
kayā (instr.). Tib. ḥjol thabs su (? perhaps {%with robe%}
{%dragging%}, sc. on the ground?); Chin. (here) apparently
{%pulling at clothes while walking%}; elsewhere, acc. to Wogihara,
Lex. 41, Chin. {%walking on tiptoe%}, and so Jap. on Mvy. The
pw 7.322 says the ‘correct’ reading would be ujjakṣikā,
and Wogihara, Lex. 41, suggests that the corresponding
Pali is ujjhaggikā (or rather, by em. ujjagghikā), Vin.
iv.187.16, which means {%laughing, derision%}, see {@uccagghati@};
this seems indeed quite possible.
