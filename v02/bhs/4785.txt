{@? kāla-valla-:@}¦ Mv ii.288.13 evaṃrūpāḥ sattvāḥ (sc.,
like the Bodhisattva) kālavalla-saṃpannāḥ, {%perfect in…(?)%};
in a series of like formulas, preceded by varṇa-saṃpannāḥ,
followed by adhyāśaya-saṃpannāḥ, Senart em. kāra-
varṇa-saṃ°, which inspires no confidence; but I have
found no light on the word. There is a v.l. kālavallabha,
which seems no better.
