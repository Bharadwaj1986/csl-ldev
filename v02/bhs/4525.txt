{@? karṇikāyā@}¦, in °yā-keyūrāṇi (in a list of various
ornaments, all noms.) LV 121.7 (prose; printed as cpd. by
Lefm.). One ms. (A) omits karṇikāyā; another reads
°kāyāṃ (loc. of °kā); Calc. karṇikāḥ; Weller 25 states that
his ms. reads karṇābharaṇāni muṇḍikābharaṇāni (for
karṇikāyā-keyūrāṇi? or for the two preceding words? his
statement is not clear). Some form or equivalent of kar-
ṇikā, {%ear-ornament%}, is doubtless meant. Tib. {%ear-ornaments%}
(rna rgyan) {%and shoulder-ornaments%} (the latter represents
keyūrāṇi).
