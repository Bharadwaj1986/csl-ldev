{@Pramukhī@}¦, (prob.) n. of a goddess or yakṣiṇī: Ma-
hāsamāj., Waldschmidt, Kl. Skt. Texte 4, 187.3; in Pali
parallel, DN ii.260.23, pāmokkhā, taken as adj. by comm.
and modern interpreters; the Skt. adj. pramukha might
be assumed in our text (with {@Avadātakeśā@}), but its fem.
seems to be only noted as pramukhā.
