({@vaṃśarāga@}¦, {%bamboo-colored%}, adj. applied to a kind
of vaiḍūrya-gem in Kauṭ. Arth., Shama-S.^1 76.19; so also
Jm 92.2 vaṃśarāga-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-vyatikara-harita-sali-
lam; in line 4 (vs) the same is described as marakata-
harita-prabhair jalair…, which misled Speyer into taking
va° as a synonym of marakata, {%emerald%}; but it is clear
from Kauṭ. that it is another green gem.)
