{@citrī-karoti@}¦ (= Pali citti°, perhaps also cittī°, see
next; derived by Childers and PTSD from Skt. citta-;
Senart, Mv i.444, accepts this and regards BHS citrī°
as false Sktization; later, he emends the forms occurring
in Mv ii and iii to cittī°; whatever the history of the
word may be, the BHS form is only citrī° or citri°); ({@1@})
ppp. {%respected, honored%}: (vayaṃ hi…) loke 'tīva citrī-
kṛtāḥ SP 215.6 (prose, no v.l.); ({@2@}) {%pays heed%}: na °kari-
ṣyati MSV i.8.1, 10, {%he will pay no heed%}; caus., {%causes to%}
{%pay heed, gets the attention of%} (acc.): (Māra tried to distract
the Bodhisattva,) na ca taṃ bodhisattvaṃ citrīkāresi
(aor.; so mss., Senart em. cittī°) Mv ii.268.11; with non-
caus. mg., and °kar° with short a in mss. except in the
first passage, Mv iii.282.6, 12; 283.2, 7, prob. read in all
approximately: na ca sānaṃ bhagavāṃ citrīkāraye (or
°karaye), {%and the Lord paid no heed to them%} (the daughters
of Māra who were seeking to distract him); the mss. are
variously corrupt; Senart em. cittīkāraye; ({@3@}) citrīkṛta
in a quite different sense: hastau saṃpuṭākārau kṛtvā
anyonyāv āveṣṭya citrīkṛtau ātmorasi sthāpayet (in a
certain mudrā) Mmk 400.28; similarly, hastāv udveṣṭya
citrīkṛtāv abhayāvasthitau 401.20; hastāv ubhayāṅgu-
ṣṭhavinyastau citrīkṛtau lalāṭe darśayed 401.25; punaḥ
citrīkṛtau karau, svastikaṃ…bandhitavyam 407.21. It
is clear that citrīkṛtau here applies always to the two
hands in various mudrā-positions, but the mg. is not
evident to me; possibly {%made elaborate%}, by intertwining
the fingers (which is apparently characteristic of these
mudrās)?
