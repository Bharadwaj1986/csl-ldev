{@pratijāgarti, °jāgarati, °jāgrati@}¦ (also {@paṭi°@}; forms,
see Chap. 43; the verb seems to be Vedic only, but a
few Skt. noun derivs. are recorded; Pali paṭijaggati,
defined in PTSD {%nourish, tend, feed, look after%} etc., hardly
covering the Pali range of mg.), ({@1@}) {%watches = stays%}
{%awake%} (opp. sleeps): devī…pratijāgaritvā Mv i.154.16
(vs); ({@2@}) {%watches = guards%}: yāmaṃ °jāgreta Ud v.15
(= Pali paṭijaggeyya, Dhp. 157; the real meaning of
yāma is obscure in both, but prob. lit. {%night-watch%}, with
thought of mg. 1 preceding; acc. to Dhp. comm. the
three {%ages%} of man), not to be em. with ed. (°jāgṛyāt un-
metrical!); kṛtyaṃ °jāgareta Ud xvi.1 (one's own acts);
here, perhaps, {@kuśalapakṣaṃ@} (q.v.) °jāgṛhi Av ii.145.2,
etc.; ({@3@}) {%attends to, looks after%}: °jāgaranti Mv i.147.11
(apsarases…the toilet operations of the Bodhisattva's
mother); (amātyehi) °jāgṛtaṃ ii.180.6, {%the ministers%}
{%attended to, carried out%} (sc. what the king had commanded);
yadā ekamātraṃ °jāgarti, tadā saptamātrāḥ saṃpadyante
Divy 124.9 (preceded by: sā yadaikaṃ vastu rakṣati tat
saptaguṇaṃ syāt: perhaps rather with mg. 2, {%guards%};
but it may well be {%attends%} to a job); ({@4@}) {%prepares%} (food):
°jāgaritvā Mv i.307.13; 324.8 (with mss. °jāgarayetvā,
to caus., or °jāgaritvā); °jāgrāhi (impv., to °jāgrati)
ii.274.12 (bhaktaṃ); iii.141.15; 255.8; 272.1 f.; Divy
306.12 (food and entertainment); Av i.257.14 (bhojanaṃ);
MSV i.233.17 ff.; ({@5@}) {%fixes up, decorates, adorns%} (orig.
prepares, for a festive event), a place: yathājñaptāni
sthānāni yathoktaṃ pratijāgriṣu Mv i.76.4 (vs), so read
with v.l. for text pari-jā°, unless MIndic paṭi-jā° was
the orig. reading, cf. § 2.47 (this might account for pari°
[Page363-a+ 71]
of some mss.); MSV i.264.2; esp. of a {%road, way%} (usually
mārga) over which a distinguished person is to pass,
pratijāgratha (impv.), {%prepare, adorn, decorate%}, Mv ii.150.2;
°jāgaretha (opt.) 153.14; °jāgariṣyāmaḥ iii.323.10; ppp.
°jāgṛta- Mv i.258.16 (amātyehi ca sarvaṃ °jāgṛtaṃ yathā
āṇattaṃ; could belong to 3 above, like Mv ii.180.6, but
the king's command was to {%adorn%} the road); ii.111.8
(amātyehi…sarvaṃ °jāgṛtaṃ mahatā samṛddhīye pra-
tyudgamanaṃ kṛtaṃ; situation like prec.); devehi mārgo
°jāgṛto iii.324.10; °jāgritaṃ Mv i.270.13; ii.150.8; mār-
gaṃ °jāgraṃsu (v.l. °jāgṛsuḥ; § 32.76) Mv i.259.3; in Mv
i.231.11 some form of this verb seems to be intended,
(daśakrośamārgaṃ) pratijāgṛhansuḥ (Senart, almost as
one ms. which has °jagṛhansuḥ; v.l. pratigrahetsuḥ);
Senart suggests contamination with prati-grah-, but this
hardly makes sense; what was done is shown by the
following (they made the road level, clean, adorned, etc.,
for the Buddha Dīpaṃkara to pass over).
