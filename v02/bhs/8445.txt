{%abandons, withdraws from%} (Sheth, ṇijjūhai: parityāg karnā),
Laṅk 115.13--14, cited s.v. {@āyūhati; (2)@} at least in Gv
used as a near-synonym of {@āyūhati@}, meaning presumably
{%effects, accomplishes%} (cf. Sheth's second mg. for ṇijjūhai:
racnā, nirmāṇ karnā; and so noun derivs.; cf. niryūha
as architectural term): Gv 69.23--24 bodhisattvavimokṣam

ā-yūh- and nir-yūh-, in what must be nearly identical
mgs., with objects tathāgatavimokṣam Gv 80.24, 25;
83.12; jñānālokamukham Gv 199.24. This may well be
the mg. of nirvyūhati, q.v., in MadhK; discussion s.v.
