{@aśubha-bhāvanā@}¦, f. pl. °nāḥ Mvy 1155; Bbh 98.18
(read aśubha-bhāvanā for ed. aśubhā-bh°); or {@aśubha-@}
{@saṃjñā@}, Bhīk 27a.2 (= Pali asubha-bhāvanā or -saññā),
see {@saṃjñā@}, {%contemplation of offensive things%}, specifically
of human corpses in various states of disintegration; there
are nine (in Pali, Vism. i.110.29--31 ten) such monkish
disciplines, elsewhere called simply nava saṃjñāh, {%the%}
{%nine concepts%} (of offensive things), ŚsP 59.1; 1258.5; a
less schematized passage of the same sort in older Pali,
MN i.58.9 ff. In Mvy 1156--64 they are listed, each cpd.
with -saṃjñā: (1) {@vinīlaka-@}, (2) {@vipūyaka-@} (so read),
(3) {@vipaḍumaka-@}, (4) {@vyādhmātaka-@}, (5) {@vilohitaka-@},
(6) {@vikhāditaka-@}, (7) {@vikṣiptaka-@}, (8) {@vidagdhaka-@},
(9) {@asthi-saṃjñā@} (see each of these). Bhīk 27a.2--3 agrees
except that it transposes Nos. 5 and 6 and accidentally
omits 8 (which perhaps should be put after 9; only Mvy
has it before 9). There are three lists (one incomplete,
[Page080-b+ 71]
one very corrupt) in ŚsP 59.1 ff., 1258.5 ff., 1431.19 ff.
(six items only; cited from the last, with only four items
one of which is not in this ŚsP list, in Śikṣ 211.1). Barring
corruptions, the ŚsP lists agree with Mvy and Bhīk ex-
cept in order of the terms, in which they show some
(slight) resemblance to the Pali (Vism.) arrangement.
ŚsP 1 (Śikṣ 1) = Vism 1 = Mvy 4; ŚsP^3 (= 1431.19 ff.)
2 = Śikṣ 2 = Vism 2 = ŚsP^1 (= 59.1 ff.) and^2 (= 1258.5 ff.)
5 = Mvy 1; ŚsP and Śikṣ 3 = Vism 3 = Mvy 2; Śikṣ 4
(not in ŚsP^3) = ŚsP^1 and ^2 2 = Vism 9 = Mvy 3; ŚsP^1
and^2 4 = ŚsP^3 5 = Vism 8 = Mvy 5 (Bhīk 6); ŚsP^1 and^2
6 = ŚsP^3 4 = Vism 5 = Mvy 6 (Bhīk 5); ŚsP^1 and^2,
Mvy 7 = ŚsP^3, Vism 6; ŚsP^1 and^2 8 = Vism 10 = Mvy 9;
ŚsP^1 and ^2 9 = Mvy 8 (omitted in Bhīk; Vism 4 has a
different term, vicchiddaka, {%fissured%} Pe Maung Tin; Vism
7 hata-vikkhittaka is variation on Vism 7 vikkhittaka =
Mvy 7). On the meanings, as well as the variants and cor-
ruptions, see the terms as listed above from Mvy.
