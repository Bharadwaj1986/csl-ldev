{@āsmākīna@}¦, adj. (prescribed Pāṇ.4.3.2), {%our%}: Av
i.327.4; so best ms., v.l. asm°, which is the form regularly
recorded in Av (see {@asmākīna@}) and which Speyer adopts
in the text here; but in ii p. 210 he withdraws that reading
in favour of āsm°. There is no record of either form, nor of
any MIndic equivalent, elsewhere.
