{@mātrī@}¦, adj. f. (to m. *mātra, from Skt. mātṛ plus
a?), {%of the mother, maternal%}: (svaka-svakā yeva) mātrīyo
bhaginīyo parasparasya vivāhitā Mv i.351.4, (the princes)
{%gave to each other in marriage each their own sisters by the%}
{%same mother%} (thus avoiding the marriage of any with his
co-uterine sister). So the Tib. version cited by Senart
p. 625; Senart misunderstands the Skt. text; he reads
mātṛyo with v.l. (and with both mss. line 8 below), but
this can only be a corruption. The Pali adj. mātiya which
he cites is not known to PTSD; Childers cites it with
no textual reference; even if a genuine Pali word, it can
hardly be concerned here.
