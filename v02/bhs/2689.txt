{@ādīkaroti@}¦ (see s.v. {@ādi@}), {%starts from%} (acc.), {%makes the%}
{%starting point%}: ger. °kariyāṇa, SP 192.1 (vs) avidya (acc.)
ādīkariyāṇa cakṣumān, prabhāṣate maraṇam anantaduḥ-
kham (so apparently mss., combining the note to KN
ed. with that to Kern's Transl. SBE 21.185), {%starting with%}
{%ignorance, the Enlightened One expounded death and infinite%}
{%misery%}. This reading is perfect in meter and sense. Pos-
sibly ādī is to be taken as a separate word, = ādiṃ;
certainly it means the same as ādiṃ kṛ-.
