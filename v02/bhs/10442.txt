{@? -pramuktaka@}¦, presumably = Skt. °kta, {%discharged%}:
(sarvaratna)-paṅktirucirasūkṣma-kusuma-reṇu-pramukta-
kān Gv 100.12 (prose); so text, but there is something wrong
with it; it occurs in a long series of acc. nt. or m. epithets,
mostly ending -aṃ, applied to a park (udyānaṃ, line 11).
The following word begins with s-, so the form could
only be acc. pl. m., which makes no sense. It would be
unsatisfactory to em. to °kaṃ; I have no suggestion.
