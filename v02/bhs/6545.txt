{@jāgarya@}¦ (read °yā ? which is recorded in Skt. Gr.
and Lex., and prob. underlies Pali and AMg. jāgariyā),
= prec.: jāgaryam anuyuktasya Ud xv.8, {%of one devoted%}
{%to%} (the discipline of) {%wakefulness%}. There is no metrical
reason for shortening ā; °yām would be just as good.
I suspect a misprint or error of tradition; prob. jāgaryām
should be read.
