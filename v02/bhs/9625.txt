{@puruṣa-damya-sārathi@}¦ (= Pali purisa-damma-sā°;
expl. Vism. 207.22 ff. essentially as here interpreted),
{%charioteer (driver, tamer, controller) of human ones-that-need-%}
{%to-be-tamed%} (= {%trained%} religiously; as Vism. indicates,
dam = vi-nī, {%discipline%}); the figure clearly refers to taming
animals, particularly horses, and indeed is no doubt
directly based on Pali assa-damma-sārathi, q.v. in CPD;
cf. such expressions as puruṣājāneya (see s.v. {@ājāneya@}),
{%noble steed of a man%}. Ep. of a Buddha, or a Bodhisattva
just before his attainment of Buddhahood. Often misunder-
stood; further evidence supporting the interpretation here
given will be found below. Tib. (on Mvy 10, LV 3.4 etc.)
skyes bu ḥdul baḥi ({%of human [to-be-] tamed ones%}, more lit.
{%of [to-be-] tamed men%}) kha lo (b)sgyur ba ({%helm-governor =%}
{%charioteer%}). In Tocharian yātäṣlyes yāpy ā(śa)nt, {%leader of%}
{%one to be tamed%} (omitting puruṣa; yāpy is uncertain,
possibly {%helm%} as in Tib.). Regularly in cliché listing
characteristics of a Buddha: SP 17.11; 65.6; 144.6; 156.4;
LV 3.4; Mvy 10; Mv i.38.12; 238.15; 330.2; 331.1; 332.4;
335.16; Divy 54.13 etc.; Av i.65.12 etc.; Suv 168.10; in
Mv i.4.9 (read with mss., and print the sentence as an
āryā vs, not prose as in Senart) puruṣasiṃhasārathinā
(Senart em. puruṣadamya°), {%controller of lions of men%},
evidently meant as a much stronger variant of the usual
term, but incidentally confirms our interpretation of the
latter; so also does the epithet puruṣadamyasārathinā in
another formulaic series of epithets applied to the Bo-
dhisattva just before his enlightenment, in which several
preceding epithets compare him to animals, such as
puruṣarṣabheṇa, puruṣasiṃhena: LV 350.12; Mv i.229.9;
ii.133.9; 284.19; 415.21; in less formulaic passages LV
428.5; abstr. °sārathi-tā, {%state of being…%}, meaning the
state of Buddhahood which Bodhisattvas are to attain:
Mv ii.260.11; 261.12.
