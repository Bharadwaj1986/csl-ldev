{@? satyadṛś-@}¦, in Divy 34.29 satyadṛśaḥ (prob. abl.
sg., like the prec. udānāt and pārāyaṇāt; one of 4 mss.
satyasadṛṣṭaḥ), and (corruptly) satyadṛṣṭaḥ 20.23 (in
almost identical context and prob. intending the same
original text), app. n. of some (section of a) Buddhist
work. Most of the other names in the list seem to be
identifiable with parts of Pali Sn; I have found no equiv-
alent for this term. After it come nom. pl. terms, (sthavi-
ragāthāḥ) śailagāthā munigāthā arthavargīyāṇi (mss. °ni
both times) ca sūtrāṇi.
