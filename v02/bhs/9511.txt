{@piṇḍapāta@}¦, m. (see {@pāta@}), or {@°pātra@} (the latter very
often, esp. in mss., tho editors often em., cf. Speyer Av
i.13 note 1; Index to Divy suggests two different words,
‘often confused’, but note that even in the cliché list of
[Page345-a+ 71]
{@pariskāra@}, q.v., piṇḍapāta occurs as always in Pali,
beside °pātra, the latter e.g. Suv 112.9; Śikṣ 41.18; Sukh
27.1; LV 2.22; also mss. at Av i.13.4 et alibi, Speyer, note
ad loc.; it seems that both forms mean simply {%alms-food%}
({%-attainment%}, put into a monk's bowl), as is quite obvious
in Pali, see Childers and PTSD, and in some BHS passages;
the BHS °pātra was doubtless due to popular etym.,
association with pātra = Pali patta, {%bowl%}; tho secondary
and unoriginal it occurs so often that it seems probably
to have been used in BHS tradition, by the side of °pāta),
{%food thrown into a monk's almsbowl%}; see also (besides s.v.
{@pariṣkāra@}) s.v. {@paścādbhakta:@} °pāta Mvy 2374; 8571;

573.10; Jm 19.25; RP 29.13; Śikṣ 128.2, 8; 215.7; Prāt

{%living by alms-begging%}, RP 57.10 (= {@°pātika@}), °pātra,
besides cases in cpds. cited above, Śikṣ 312.14; v.l. in Mvy
