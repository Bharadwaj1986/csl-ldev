{@varaṇa@}¦, nt., a high number: Mvy 7852 (cited from
Gv); prob. = {@vivaraṇa@}, Gv 105.25; but cf. also Gv
105.26, perh. read sattva-varaṇasya (gen.) for sattva-ṇa-
varaṇasya; no equivalent seems to occur in the similar
list Gv 133 (it should occur about line 10). Tib. on Mvy
gzhal dpag, the same as the rendering of {@dharaṇa@}, q.v.;
this suggests that one or the other is a corruption. But
Gv supports varaṇa, while the Tib. rendering seems to
support dharaṇa, which in Skt. is the name of a weight
(Tib. gzhal).
