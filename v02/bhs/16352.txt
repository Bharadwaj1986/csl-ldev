{@saṃmukham@}¦, adv. and postpos. (cf. prec.; used in
Skt. in somewhat similar but, it seems, not quite identical
ways), ({@1@}) adv., {%in personal presence%}, without dependent
noun: replacing adj. {@saṃmukha@}, q.v., with gāthā, as
in ābhiḥ sārūpyābhir gāthābhiḥ °kham (note position,
which is very exceptional but significant, proving that
saṃmukham has no dependent) abhiṣṭutya SP 162.8;
bhagavantaṃ °kham ābhir gāthābhiḥ…161.4; 166.4,
and similarly 166.12; 170.6; 172.15; LV 361.14; 362.19;
364.17; Mv iii.343.14 (read with mss.); Sukh 7.9; Bhaga-
vatā (in Av Ānandena) sārdhaṃ °khaṃ…kathāṃ
vyatisārya Divy 70.10; 619.1; Karmav 29.17; Av i.229.2;
saṃmukhaṃ me bhadanta Bhagavato 'ntikāc chrutaṃ
°kham udgṛhītam Divy 206.28, {%from the Lord in person%}
{%I heard and received%}; the position of saṃmukham in this
Divy passage seems to prove that it is a pure adv., without
dependent, also in bhagavato 'ntikāt °khaṃ śrutvā SP
69.7, and (with slight variations) 70.12; 100.2; 222.9;
doubtless so interpret also śāstu saṃmukhaṃ śāṇaṃ
pāṃśukūlaṃ pratigrahe Mv iii.54.15 (repetition 16),
(Kāśyapa) {%received from the Teacher%} (prob. abl., śāstu)
{%face to face a robe…%}; ({@2@}) postpos. with gen., {%in the presence%}
{%(of)%}: so prob. (cf. s.v. {@saṃmukhā@} 1) bhagavato saṃmu-
khaṃ pratiśrutvā °khaṃ pratigṛhītvā (so with 1 ms.,
Senart em. wrongly) Mv ii.257.15, {%having heard and accepted%}
{%it in the Lord's own presence%} (but possibly {%from the Lord,%}
{%in his presence%}, as in Divy 206.28 above); bahudharmaḥ
śruto 'smābhir lokanāthasya saṃmukhaṃ SP 70.3 (vs);
naigamajānapadānāṃ ca °kham evaṃ saṃśrāvayet 108.8
(prose); me…°kham 342.1 (vs), {%in my presence%}; ({@3@}) with
a verb of giving, {%to%}, with loc. or gen.: dadanti dānāni…
jineṣu °kham SP 13.11 (vs), {%they give gifts to the Jinas%};
virtually same phrase with jināna °kham 13.14, and suga-
tāna °kham 13.16 (vss).
