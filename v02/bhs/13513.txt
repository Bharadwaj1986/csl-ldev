{@vāyana@}¦, nt. (recorded once in Skt., pw 7.373 °na-
kriyā, {%weaving-activity%}), ({@1@}) (act of) {%weaving%}: paṭa-vāyana
Mmk 57.27, 29; 59.27; ({@2@}) {%causing%} (a weaver) {%to weave%}
(a robe for himself; a sin for a monk): Mvy 8409 = Tib.
ḥthag tu ḥjug pa, {%causing to weave%}; refers to the rule of
Pali Vin. iii.256.26--27; var. vayanam, which Mironov
adopts, but noting v.l. vāyanam; in view of the causative
mg., the ā-form seems likely to be right (cf. {@vāpayati@},
Pali vāyāpeti); vayana is unrecorded except Skt. Gr.
(BR). [In Mvy 6248 pw reads vāyana for {@vayana@}, q.v.]
