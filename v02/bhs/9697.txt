pūrṇāḥ [ed. as one word!] SP 9.3 and 24.1; aśīti so antara-
kalpa pūrṇāṃ [with aśīti, acc.] 26.12; aśīti pūrṇāḥ 62.3

[so divide] pūrṇāṃ 68.11; cf. next vs, dvātriṃśatī antara-
kalpa sthāsyatī 69.1; note the same use of paripūrṇa, in:
°ṇa so antarakalpa [so divide] ṣaṣṭim 25.8, {%for full 60%}
{%intermediate kalpas%}; sahasr' aśītiḥ paripūrṇa ye sthitāḥ
