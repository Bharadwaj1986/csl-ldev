{@vaṭṭanā@}¦ ({@valī@}, i.e. °nā-āvalī; = Pali °ḷi), {%(string of)%}
{%bead(s)%}; so to be read for Senart's em. vaṭṭanaveṇī Mv
ii.125.16; 127.4; 128.9; 129.12; and (em. veṣṭanaveṇī)
231.17. The mss. are all corrupt but clearly point to
(ā)valī, in accordance with Pali, rather than veṇī in which
Senart follows the LV parallels, see {@vartanā(-veṇī)@}; the
mg. is the same and is explained under the latter word.
