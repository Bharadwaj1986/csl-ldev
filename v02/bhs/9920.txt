{@praṇidhāna@}¦, nt. (m. modifiers Bhad 58; = Pali
paṇidhāna; like {@praṇidhi@}, n. act. to {@praṇidadhāti,@}
{@praṇidheti@}), {%fixation%} of mind (ceto-pra° Mv i.239.5;
iii.138.19; Pali ceto-paṇidhi), and so {%ardent desire, earnest%}
{%wish, vow%}; sometimes (but rarely) of purely worldly
desires, which are reprobated, praṇidhāna-vivarjitam SP
142.8 (vs); usually religious at least in basis, fulfilment
being expected on the ground of acts of merit, which are
often mentioned in a solemn declaration of wish; the thing
desired may nevertheless be worldly (wealth, or special
marks of grace), tho often the intention is stated to use
it for religious-purposes: Mv i.302.19 (magic possession of
garlands); iii.414.12 (fortunate rebirths); Divy 23.17;
65.10 (to become a cakravartin); or it may be truly religious,
yet not Buddhahood or Bodhisattvahood, SP 242.4 (here
made by a past Buddha, to do services to Buddhas to
come); most commonly to win enlightenment, i.e. to
become a Buddha, SP 43.12; LV 31.22 (°na-paripūryai, so
with mss.; cf. {@praṇidhi-@}paripūriye); 180.1; 415.15; Mv
i.39.8; 104.3; 239.5; iii.138.19; Divy 66.22; 90.3; Av i.8.12;
praṇidhāna-caryā, {%a whole course of praṇidhānas%}, Mv i.1.3,
see s.v. {@caryā@}; when made by a Bodhisattva it may mean
rather the vow to follow the Bodhisattva-course, and may
then be called specifically caryā-pra° SP 64.13, 14, or
bhadracarī-pra° Bhad 2, etc.; praṇidhāna is one of the
ten bala of a Bodhisattva, Mvy 764, and one of his vaśitā,
Mvy 778; anuloma-pra° Mv i.1.11, {%continued successive pra°%},
seems to mean a pra° repeated by the same individual
(Śākyamuni in previous incarnations as cakravartin), in
similar terms, as described later in i.48.17 ff.; there are
ten mahāpraṇidhāna of a Bodhisattva, Dbh 14.15 ff.,
described at length (ten such are referred to in Sūtrāl. iv.
12, but the list quoted from another source by Lévi, note
to Transl., is quite different from the Dbh list); four
pūrva-praṇidhāna-padāni LV 204.16, each described in
the sequel in an entire paragraph; three kinds of pra°
Dharmas 112, viz. susthāna-prābandhikam (see {@prāban-@}
{@dhika@}), sattvārtha-prābandhikam, buddhakṣetra-pariśo-
dhakam. Rarely {@prārthanā@}, q.v., appears to be used of
the {%‘earnest wish’%} for enlightenment.
