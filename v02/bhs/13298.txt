{@varāṅga@}¦, adj. (Skt. vara-aṅga; in Skt. recorded as
Bhvr. only in a gloss in Amarakośa; not noted Pali or
Pkt., but see below), lit. {%having excellent (bodily) members%};
so Tib. yan lag mchog, on LV and Mvy: ep. of heroic
sons,…śūrāṇāṃ vīrāṇāṃ °ga-rūpiṇāṃ parasainyapra-
mardakānāṃ Mv i.49.5; 193.18; ii.158.17 and LV 18.6;
of the four divisions of an army, rājā caturaṅgād bala-
kāyād vara-varāṅgān hastino 'śvān rathān manuṣyāṃś ca
vahaneṣv āropya Tāmradvīpaṃ saṃprasthitaḥ Divy
527.27, {%the king loaded on boats the severally%} (i.e. in each
department; vara-va°) {%best-membered elephants, horses,%}
{%chariots, and men from his four-membered army, and…%};
varāṅga-balam Mvy 8211, {%strength of a varāṅga%}. Acc. to
pw 7.372, the mg. would be {%elephant%} (so Skt. Lex.) in
Mvy and Divy (so also Index to Divy). But the word in
Divy clearly applies to all four regular divisions of an
Indian army, specifically named here; if it meant {%elephant%}
it would duplicate hastino. And in Mvy it is placed between
{@mahānagna-@} and {@praskandi-@}balam (see these words),
and separated from prākṛtahasti and gandhahasti-b° in
8208--9. In MPS 31.21 a varāṅga's power rates very high,
just below that of an {@ardha-nārāyaṇa@}, above that of a
{@mahānagna@} and {@praskandin@}. PTSD s.v. vīra regards
this as ‘distorted’ from vīraṅga-as in Pali; on the con-
trary, I believe the Pali cliché DN i.89.5 etc. is compressed
from an original closer to Mv i.49.5 etc.; it reads puttā
…sūrā vīraṅgarūpā parasenappamaddanā (vīraṅga- for
BHS vīrā varāṅga-).
