{@buddha-kṣetra@}¦, nt. (= Pali, late, °khetta), {%Buddha-%}
{%field, region or%} (usually) {%world%} or {%world-system%} in which a
particular Buddha lives and operates; see Teresina Rowell,
‘The background and early use of the Buddhakṣetra
concept,’ The Eastern Buddhist 6.199--430 and 7.131--176,
where the term is ably discussed; a few out of many
occurrences are here recorded: descriptions of a b°, SP
65.9 ff.; 144.9 ff.; its ‘jewels’ are Bodhisattvas SP 66.3;
in Mv ii.301.16 Bodhisattvas in numberless b° take the
form of gods and come to Śākyamuni as he is about to
become enlightened; misc., Mvy 3065; Mv ii.319.11;
349.17; iii.139.3; 342.1; in Mv i.123.4 ff. enumeration of
some ‘present’ Buddha-fields and their Buddhas; huddha-
kṣetraṃ viśodhenti bodhisattvā(ḥ) Mv i.283.3; atuliya
(so mss.) aprameyaṃ °traṃ aparimitaṃ bharitvā ({%having%}
{%filled%}) sameti (= śamayati) khila-doṣa-mohaṃ (so read,
see s.v. {@khila@}) Mv ii.295.9; on {%‘emptying’%} of buddha-fields,
see s.v. {@riñcati@}; in Mv i.121.14 ff. the question is asked
whether Buddhas are produced in all Buddha-fields, and
the answer, 122.2--3, is negative; in many there is no
Buddha; Śikṣ 147.15 speaks of going to a buddhaśūnya-
buddhakṣetram as an evil fate; so in SP 68.2 (vs; cf.
66.3 ff., prose, same subject) buddhakṣetra is clearly
equated with {@lokadhātu@}, meaning merely {%world-system%},
presumably as {%potential field for a Buddha%}, but not ne-
cessarily containing one; on this see Rowell, op. cit., 415.
