{@acchati@}¦ (= Pali id., Pkt. acchai), {%sits%}: acchā drume
tuva LV 343.2 (vs) {%sit at the tree!%}; [(pīṭhe) acchati Mv
ii.379.5 (vs), but this is surely an error for acchambhī of
Śikṣ 303.3, which meter requires;] kausīdyaṃ acchati
Śikṣ 298.4 (could be {%sits in sloth%}, but might also be {%goes to%}
{%sloth%} as Bendall assumes following Pischel 480; in LV
this is impossible).
