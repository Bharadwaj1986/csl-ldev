{@satya-vacana@}¦ and {@satya-vākya@}, nt., (see also {@abhi-@}
[Page554-b+ 71]
{@yācanā@}; = Pali sacca-vacana, more often sacca-kiriyā),
{%solemn statement of truth%} as a means of magic control of
events (cf. Burlingame, JRAS 1917.429 ff.): °vākyena Mv
ii.97.9, 17, 20, °vacanena 19 (by this a kiṃnarī is bound);
°vākya ii.218.4; 229.15; °vacana 218.15 ff., 229.17 ff. (by
this an ascetic boy killed by a poisoned arrow is revived);
°vacana Divy 473.19 ff. (by this a woman changes her
sex); 571.5 ff.; SP 413.8, see {@satyādhiṣṭhāna@}. The ‘Skt.’
satyakriyā is cited in BR and pw only from a review of
Hardy's Eastern Monachism in Ind. Stud. 3.119; if it
actually occurs, even in BHS, I have failed to note it;
is it perhaps a modern Sktization of the Pali saccakiriyā ?
