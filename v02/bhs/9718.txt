defined PTSD as = peta; it means {%spirit of an ancestor%},
or at least {%of a deceased member of one's family%}; this is
clear from DN comm. i.90.28, on i.8.2, atīte ñāti-kathā,
as gloss on pubbapetakathā; and Pv comm. 17.26--27

{%ancestor%} or {%deceased member of the family%}; as object of
worship: pūrvapeta-pūjakaṃ tat kulaṃ (in which the
