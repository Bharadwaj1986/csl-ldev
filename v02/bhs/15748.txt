{@saṃdhā@}¦ (cf. the Skt. mg. {%Absicht%}, pw s.v. 3, and
{@saṃdhāya@}), {%(special, cryptic,) esoteric meaning%}, the ‘real’
meaning of a Buddhist text or doctrine, opp. to its prima
facie or superficial meaning; perh. always in comp. with
a word for {%speech, words%}, or the like; but see also {@saṃ-@}
{@dhi@} (5); see {@ābhiprāyika@}, which S.K. De, NIA 1.5, is
right in relating to this; my note in JAOS 57.185 ff. is
prob. misleading in regarding {%complete meaning%} as basic;
Tib. regularly dgoṅs (te), {%meaning, intention%}, often pre-
ceded, sometimes replaced, by ldem po(r), {%in a riddlesome%}
{%way%}; nevertheless the implication of the word is always
{%fundamental, ‘real’ meaning%}, as is esp. shown by SP 60.12--13
(prose) yat punar bhagavann asmābhir anupasthiteṣu bo-
dhisattveṣu saṃdhābhāṣyaṃ bhagavato 'jānamānais tva-
ramāṇaiḥ prathamabhāṣitaiva tathāgatasya dharmadeśanā
śrutvodgṛhītā, {%but in as much, Lord, as we, not knowing%}
{%the Lord's words as He really intended them%} ({%esoterically,%}
{%cryptically%}, Tib. ldem por dgoṅs te bśad pa), {%there being%}
{%no bodhisattvas on hand, in our haste heard and accepted%}
{%merely His prima-facie words%}; so, saṃdhā-bhāṣya (Tib.
usually as above) SP 29.7; 34.2, 10; 39.11; 70.5 (vs, Tib.
ldem ṅag, omitting dgoṅs) and 8 (vs, Tib. as in 60.12--13
but om. ldem por); 273.14 and 337.2 (vss); saṃdhā-bhāṣita
(Tib. generally as in 60.12--13) 125.2, 3 (see below; ldem
por om. in 3); 199.2 (gsuṅs for bśad); 233.11 (parama-
saṃdhā-bhāṣita-vivaraṇo hy ayaṃ dharmaparyāyas);
288.2; saṃdhā-vacanehi, °naṃ, SP 59.4 and 5 (here Tib.
om. dgoṅs; in 4 ldem poḥi ṅag [= bśad or gsuṅs] rnams,
{%riddle-words%}; in 5 ldem po ṅag); note Buddha's words in
[Page557-a+ 71]
SP 125.1 na sahasaiva sarvajñajñānaṃ saṃprakāśayāmi,
{%I do not reveal the Omniscient's knowledge all at once%}, given
as reason for his hearers' failure to understand saṃdhā-
bhāṣitaṃ, since (3) …durvijñeyaṃ…tathāgatānāṃ
…saṃdhābhāṣitam. Note that this form seems to occur
only in SP, while the ger. saṃdhāya is more widespread;
saṃdhi, however, seems to be used, tho rarely, in the
same sense, and once in Laṅk text has {@saṃdhyā-bhāṣya@},
q.v., clearly in this same mg., and prob. error for saṃdhā°.
