{@Kuṇḍopadhānīyaka@}¦, lit. app. {%using a water-jar for%}
{%a pillow%} (so BR), ep. of {@Pūrṇa@} (4), q.v.: Divy 44.8; 45.1,
where he is declared by the Buddha to be the first of
receivers of food-tickets ({@śalākā@}, 3, q.v.) among his
disciples. This identifies him with Pali Kuṇḍa-dhāna (see
DPPN s.v.), a name also applied in DPPN to 1 Puṇṇa;
Kuṇ° seems to be his regular name, but it is said to have
been originally Dhāna, and the prefixation of Kuṇḍa-is ex-
plained in a way which would not fit the BHS epithet.
