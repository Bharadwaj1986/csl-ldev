{@? mūdhāma@}¦ (m.; so text by em.; read rather mu-
dhāma or mūḍhāma), acc. to context apparently {%idle%} or
{%deluded religious longings%}, see s.v. 2 {@āma:@} ŚsP 485.(14--)15
(na ca bodhisattvo mahāsattvo) mūdhāmaṃ patati, text.
But this is an em.; all mss. mūrdhānaṃ, and so in same
locution 17, where ed. inconsistently reads with mss.
Note to 15 suggests reading mudhāmaṃ and interprets by
[Page436-b+ 71]
vyartha-dharmābhilāṣaḥ. The ŚsP itself authorizes this
interpretation of {@āma@}. It gives no hint as to how it read
or interpreted the prior member; it might be Skt. and
Pali mudhā, as ed. suggests, or mūḍha, {%deluded%}. It seems
clear from the context that the mss. reading is corrupt
and that the true text had a cpd. ending -āmaṃ (acc. ṣg.).
