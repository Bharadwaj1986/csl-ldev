{@anuvidiś@}¦, f. (blend of Skt. vidiś and Pali anudisā),
{%supplementary direction, semi-cardinal point%}, = vidiś, in
Bcṭ 328.11 (= Śikṣ 245.18, where text na tu vidiśam); in
Śikṣ 252.15 text correctly nānuvidiśaṃ (acc. sg.); in these
adhaḥ and ūrdhvam are separately mentioned, as in AsP
481.18--19 mordhvaṃ mādho mā cānuvidiśam avalokayan
gāḥ; but for this fact, Sukh 36.11 could easily be taken to
prove that anu° means specifically the nadir and zenith,
since, after the 4 cardinal points (°paścimottarāsu dikṣu),
it follows with adha ūrdhvam anuvidikṣu. But the above
passages show that adha ūrdhvam in Sukh must not be
taken with anu°, which must apparently mean instead {%the%}
{%semicardinal points%} (not otherwise mentioned here).
