<L>3411<pc>125,1<k1>उत्पत्तति<k2>उत्पत्तति
{@utpattati@}¦ (ger. °ttitvā(na), ppp. °ttita; app. blend
of utpatati with a quasi-denom. from utpatti, or modi-
fication of utpatati by confusion with utpatti; Senart
i.374 n.), {%springs up, goes forth, flies up%}: °tvā Mv i.6.8 ff.
(prose), six times, subject {%rays of light%}, arci(s), as also with
ppp. °tā Mv i.26.3 (prose; in same line nipatitāyo, {%fallen%}
{%down%}); °tvā Mv ii.243.11 (prose), subject śakuntako,
hence clearly to root pat, {%fly%}; ger. °tvāna, Mv iii.456.5,
subject inhabitants of hell; in parallel to this, i.11.15,
Senart reads utpatitvāna, but mss. (upetitvāna or upentit-
vāna) are equally favorable to utpatti°; the mg. could be
{%having gone (flown?) forth%}, or perhaps {%having originated,%}
{%been (re-) born%}.
