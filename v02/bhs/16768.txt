{@sāhasra-cūḍika@}¦, m. (cf. Pali sahassī cūḷanikā loka-
dhātu), n. of a lokadhātu: Mvy 3042. Cf. repeatedly in
AsP sāhasre cūḍike (or, cūḍikāyāṃ) lokadhātau, loc., the
cpd. apparently divided into two words, sāhasre, always
m., but cūḍikāyāṃ, f., in AsP 65.3; 66.2, and so v.l., one
ms. out of six, 105.13, 16; 108.3, 5; but cūḍike text with
5 mss. in these four places, and elsewhere, e.g. 117.18,
without v.l.; no reading with cūḍikāyāṃ has been noted
except in the passages cited; (sahasrika)ś cyūḍiko (read
cū°) lokadhātuḥ MPS 31.46. The form cūḍ° evidently
means {%small, minor%}, and is related to Pali cūḷa, culla.
Contrasted with {@dvisāhasra…@} and {@trisāhasramahā-@}
{@sāhasra…@}, qq.v. In ŚsP 26.8 and elsewhere replaced by
sāhasre lokadhātau, see {@sāhasra@}.
