{@nagarāvalambaka@}¦, m., and {@°ikā@}, f., seemingly {%city-%}
{%washerman%} and {%-woman%}: m. only Śikṣ 9.4 tṛṇapradīpaṃ
dattvā nagarāvalambaka-bhūtena (Bendall and Rouse,
ignoring the fem. counterpart, {%inhabitant of the outskirts%}
{%of the town%}, without evident justification); f. °ikā Mv
iii.311.8, 18; 312.12 (no v.l.), apparently a woman whose
job it was to hang out clothes (to dry?), cf. 311.11 pāṃ-
sukūlaṃ (which she has just presented to the Bodhisattva)
vṛkṣaśākhāye olambitvā; the gerund seems to suggest
her occupation. Senart Introd. p. xxix, {%étendeuse de linge%}
(which is surely far better than his suggestion, note p. 505,
that velambikā be read by em.; this is clearly impossible,
see s.v. {@velambaka@}); Divy 82.11, 28; 84.24; 89.20, 26 =
MSV i.80.16 ff. (in these passages no light seems to be
thrown on the meaning by the context).
