[{@pariśraddhāḥ@}¦, em. in LV 184.5, where mss. un-
metrically gṛha-dhana-(Lefm. em. m.c. gṛhe dhane)-putra-
bhārya-pariśuddhaḥ or °dhaṃ; Tib. for the last member
chags, {%devoted, attached, fond%}; no pari-śrad-dhā is recorded,
and the em. seems implausible, but the mss. reading can
hardly be right. The best em. that has occurred to me is
pariṣaktāḥ, to Skt. pari-sajjate; see {@pariṣakta@} for an-
other possible occurrence.]
