{@vyavacāra@}¦, m. (to {@vyavacārayati@}), ({@1@}) {%wandering%} or
{%searching through%} (localities): (Sudarśanaṃ bhikṣuṃ mārga-
yamāṇo) janapada-°reṣu nagara-°reṣu, etc. (long series of
locs. like these) Gv 127.16 ff.; sarvasattvabhājana-(text
°nā-)-loka-°reṣu (see s.v. {@bhājana@}) sarvasattvagati-°reṣu Gv

{%wanderings, searchings%} (or, {%considerations%})?; ({@2@}) prob. (cf.

{%intellectual mastery%}: samādhi-samudraṃ ca samādhi-
vyutthānaṃ ca samādhi-°raṃ ca…adrākṣīt Gv 148.23.
See also {@a-vyavacāra@}; if my assumption of the neg. in
that word is right, it would mean lit. {%non-consideration%};
otherwise, if we must assume {@vyavacāra@}, not a-vy°, it
is hard to see how the mg. {%contempt%} (which seems inevitable)
could be explained.
