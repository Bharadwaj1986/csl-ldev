{@āyatana@}¦, nt. (in Skt. {%seat, abiding-place, home%}; the
following senses seem hardly, if at all, to occur in Skt.,
but most of them apparently in Pali), ({@1@}) {%department, field%}

sarvaśilpāyatanehi…kuśo kumāro viśiṣyati, {%Prince Kuśa%}
{%excelled in all departments of art%}; but the same word is also
used ({@2@}) personally, applying to practitioners of the arts
(perhaps as {%vessels%}, pātra, of the arts, cf. 3 below): Mv
iii.113.12 sarve ca kapilavāstavyā śilpāyatanā (as masc. ?
one ms. °nāḥ!), tad yathā lohakārakā etc. (list of artisans),
{%all the artisans of Kapilavastu, such as…%}; similarly
iii.442.17 śilpāyatanā (no v.l.), tad yathā lohakārakā etc.;
in the same way tīrthyāyatana ({%vessel of heresy?%}) is used
of heretical teachers Av i.231.3 yānīmāni…pṛthag loke

tīrthyāyatanāni, tad yathā, Pūraṇaḥ Kāśyapo Māskarī etc.

{%school%} or {%doctrine%} (acc. to Ledi Sadaw JPTS 1913.117
{%harbours of error%}), or at least, it seems, never clearly of
persons (some passages are ambiguous and might be so
interpreted); Pali sippāyatana also does not seem to be
applied to artisans, but only to crafts; ({@3@}) {%a worthy object%}
(cf. {@an-āy°@}), = Skt. pātra: Divy 419.(22--)23 (api tu

six), distinguished as {@bāhira@} (= Pali id.) or bāhya āy°:
Mvy 2027 dvādaśāyatanāni, listed 2028--2039 in pairs,
each cpd. with āyatanam (cakṣur-āy° etc.); the standard
list contains six of each category, viz. cakṣus and rūpa,
śrotra and śabda, ghrāṇa and gandha, jihvā and rasa, kāya
and {@spraṣṭavya@} (q.v.), manas and {@dharma@} (2); Dharmas
24 lists each group of six as a (dvandva) cpd. concluded by
āyatanāni (with sparśa in lieu of spraṣṭavya); Śikṣ 244.15
ṣaḍ imāni…sparśāyatanāni, katamāni ṣaṭ, cakṣuḥ
