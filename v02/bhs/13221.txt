{@? vaṭhara@}¦, adj. (= Pali Lex. id.; rarely in Skt.
{%stupid, dull%}), {%large, gross%}: Mv ii.65.3, applied to a lizard,
godhā; but the reading is quite doubtful; v.l. jaṭharā;
and in 5 both mss. (raudrāṃ) japarāṃ, intending jaṭh°
(Senart em. vaṭharāṃ); it seems likely that (Skt.) jaṭhara,
{%hard%} (or {%old?%}), should be assumed.
