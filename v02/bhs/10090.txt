{@prati-vaśa@}¦, adj., {%obedient%} (to), {%subject to the will%} (of),
with gen.: mama °śāś ca syuḥ Ud xiii.4, in a vs = Pali
Dhp. 74 mam’ evātivasā assu. The Pali ativasa is isolated,
strange, and difficult (see CPD), and BHS prativaśa seems
a more natural and comprehensible form, tho also un-
paralleled as far as I know.
