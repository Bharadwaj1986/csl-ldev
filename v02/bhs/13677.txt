{@vigrāhin@}¦, {%grasping, laying hold of%} (Tib. ḥdzin): svacit-
tārtha-vigrāhiṇah Laṅk 374.6 (vs), app. {%seizing (appre-%}
{%hending?) the objects of one's own mind%} (? no subject ex-
pressed in the vs; Suzuki supplies {%all things%}; he renders
otherwise and implausibly); °hiṇaḥ may also be gen. sg.,
{%for one who apprehends…%} Or perh. {%seduced by%} (cf. {@vigrā-@}
{@hayati@})? Tib. ḥdzin, lit. {%seize%}, also {%to be taken in,…cap-%}
{%tivated%}, as by sin (Jä.). One Chin. rendering (misprinted
in Suzuki's Index) means {%bind%} (as with ropes).
