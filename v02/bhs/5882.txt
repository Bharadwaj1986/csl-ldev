{@? gomaya@}¦, m., {%offal, refuse%}, if this word is intended in
Mv ii.65.7 gomayo ti (so Senart for mss. gometi) kṛtvā na
siddhā, {%thinking it was offal, I did not prepare it as food%};
foll. by, kumāro āha, na eṣā godhā abhakṣyā, bhakṣyā eṣā
manuṣyāṇāṃ. As Senart remarks, this seems a strange
use of gomaya, and I share his suspicion of the reading,
but can suggest no good emendation.
