{@kahāpaṇa@}¦ (= Pali id., for Skt. kārṣāpaṇa, a coin),
only in °ṇa-māṃsika, nt., or °kā, f., or °kaṃ, adv. (so
read for Senart's text °māsikaṃ, see esp. the ms. reading
at iii.260.14), {%cutting from the body pieces of flesh the size%}
{%of a small coin%}, a form of torture, called in Pali kahā-
paṇaka: Mv iii.258.18 (kāmaṃ) khalu me śākyā kāyaṃ
tīkṣṇena śastreṇa kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ (°kāṃ?) pi chin-
detsuḥ; in Pali lists of tortures, e.g. MN i.87.16, kahā-
[Page175-a+ 71]
paṇakaṃ is regularly preceded by balisa-maṃsikaṃ (baḷ°),
see s.v. {@biliśa-@}; in Mv iii.260.14, verse version of the
same passage, Senart reads kahāpaṇa-, but the single
ms. obviously read {@kārṣāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@} (°kāṃ?), i.e.
the Sktized form; see this, and {@kārṣāpaṇa-chedikam@},
another expression for the same.
