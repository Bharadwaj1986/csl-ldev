{@pratikramati@}¦, {%abstains%} (from sin, abl.): mss. in Mv
i.145.10 (vs) paruṣavacanāc ca naravara pratikramāmi
tathaivaṃ paiśunyaṃ (read °yāt, or with Senart °yā,
abl.); Senart em. to prativiramāmi, which to be sure
seems to be intended by prativiremi of mss. in parallel
i.202.7; but there is no need to em. i.145.10; the ppp.
pratikrāntaḥ is evidently meant in a closely similar way
in Mvy 2563, in a list of ‘synonyms for {@nisṛjā@}’, {%abstained,%}
{%withdrawn%} (from evil).
