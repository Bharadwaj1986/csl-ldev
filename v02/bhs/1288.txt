{@aparādhyati@}¦ (cf. AMg. avarajjhati (2), {%to be destroyed,%}
{%to be ruined%}, Ratnach., naṣṭa honā, Sheth; naśyati often
means {%disappear!%}), {%disappears%}: Mv ii.137.9 (śakuntā…)
aparādhyetsuḥ, aor.; so mss., Senart em. apavidhyinsuḥ, but
this could only mean {%were thrown away%}, which is completely
inappropriate; in Mv ii.139.4, in identical context, mss.
aparijhiṃsuḥ (°nsuḥ), Senart em. °vijhinsuḥ; read perhaps
MIndic aparajjhiṃsuḥ, cf. AMg. above; in any case some
form related to apa-rādh, aor., {%disappeared%}.
