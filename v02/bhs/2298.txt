{@avyavacāra@}¦, m., (neg. of {@vyavacāra@}, q.v.), {%non-%}
{%consideration, contempt, despising%} (Tib. khyad du gsod pa,
{%despise%}): Mvy 8510, in śikṣāpadadravyatāvyavacāraḥ,
which I analyze °dravyatā-avyavacāraḥ, as the Tib. and
the sense seem to require (the situation is that of Vin.
iv. 143.16--19; the Pali equivalent is vivaṇṇaka, line 19).
It seems hardly possible that {@vyavacāra@}, without a neg.,
should have this mg.
