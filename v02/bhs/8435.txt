{%accomplished roots of merit%}, as if niryāta-kuśalamūlasya (per-
haps rather {@nirjāta-?@}); it is often hard to distinguish this
mg. from 3, below; the foll. cases seem to me more likely
to belong here: parārthapratipatti-niryāṇa-Śikṣ 7.16--17,
{%expertness%} (not {%dying%}, Bendall and Rouse) {%in accomplishing%}
{%the interests of others%}; so prob. when praṇidhi (°dhāna)

the same must follow with parapudgalānāṃ ca yāna-
