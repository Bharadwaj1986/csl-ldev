{@pīṭhikā, (1)@}¦ {%base, pedestal%} (of a divine figure; cf. Skt.
pīṭha): pṛthivī tasya pī° Kv 15.9 (misprinted pīthikā);
this is the definition of pw, but perhaps {%footstool%} is at least
equally probable; ({@2@}) in Kv 32.18 perh. error for piṭakā
or piṭikā = Skt. piṭaka, {%basket%}, in lit. sense (cf. {@pīṭhaka@}):
pīṭhikām upagṛhya, said of Rāma (Viṣṇu) masquerading
as a brahman dwarf in mendicant's garb; pīṭhikā surely
means something which an ascetic might carry (hardly
{%footstool!%}).
