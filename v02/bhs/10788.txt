{@ploti@}¦, f., see also next, and {@-plotika@}, ifc. Bhvr.
(= {@pilotika@}, q.v.; Skt. ploti, {%piece of cloth%}, so read with
Gaṇapati Sastri for plauti of Shama Sastri, Kauṭ Arth.,
Shama S.^1 80.9, in ii.11; also Skt. plota; both for *proti,
*prota, from Skt. pra-vayati; note the denom. ger. pro-
tayitvā, implying protayati, thrice in KātyŚrS, see BR;
this seems to mean {%having fastened, tied on%} or {%in%}, which
implies a meaning like that here suggested for the under-
lying noun *proti or *prota), seems to mean {%cord%}, as
{%connecting link%} or {%bond%}: chiefly in karma-ploti, e.g. pūrvikā
°tir vyākṛtā bhavati Divy 150.24, {%the previous action-%}
{%(binding-) cord has been explained%}; so, regularly with forms
of vyākaroti, Divy 87.8; 89.5; 241.25-26; Av i.242.9;
244.1; 246.11 et alibi; Mārāś ca Mārakarmāṇi ca karma-
plotayaś ca Laṅk 240.11 (as matters of which an explana-
tion is asked); -plotika alone in chinna-°kaḥ, ep. of dharma,
Mvy 1306; Av ii.106.11; Tib. on Mvy rgyun ma (? rgyun
= srotas, {%stream, continuity%}; error for rgyu, {%cause?%} cf.
Chin.) bcad pa ({%cut%}); Chin. {%having cut off causes%}; Jap. {%cut%}
{%off ties%} or {%bonds of karman%}. Also (chinna-){@pilotika@}, q.v.
Both Mvy and Av use this cpd. in a cliché occurring in
Pali, e.g. MN i.141.21; here the comm. ii.119.19 ff. ex-
plains chinna-pilotiko (of dhammo) as {%having its rags cut%}
{%off%}, like a fresh garment (cf. {@pilotika@}, 1), but he offers
two different, and equally fantastic, explanations of the
specific application of the term, and gives the impression
that he is merely guessing.
