{@apakṣāla@}¦, m., {%fault, defect, failing, sin%}: Bbh 351.17
(catvāraḥ) °lāḥ, te prahīṇā bhavanti (they are then listed;
as a result of the riddance, the vihāra becomes supari-
śuddha, line 21); 352.23 sarvāpakṣālāpagata-; cf. Wogi-
hara, Lex. 17; in Mvy 7069 v.l. for Kyoto ed. {@apakṣaṇa@},

Jap. {%evil, calamity%}; Śikṣ 145.6 ata evodārakuśalapakṣa-
vivarjanatā 'pakṣāla ity ucyate (Bendall and Rouse
{%throwing away%}, but the above meaning would fit well;
Tib. ma bsruṇs pa, could mean {%non-observance%}); but acc.
to the Kyoto ed. of Mvy (above), Chinese versions of
Śikṣ prove that its text had a form of -kṣaṇ- (which is
said to be phonetically reproduced in the Chin.). Bendall
and Rouse compare Pali khalayati, in Jāt. iv.205.13
(correct their ref.) khalayātha; comm. khalīkāraṃ pāpetvā
niddhamatha. Cf. also Pali avakkhalita, {%mistake, offense%}
(CPD), which is connected with Skt. skhal-. Is apakṣāla
an unhistorical back-formation from a MIndic word
related to this latter? Despite the alleged Chinese support
for apakṣaṇa, it seems a questionable reading, and apak-
ṣāla should prob. be read, with Mironov in Mvy (as well
as in Śikṣ, for which no v.l. is recorded).
