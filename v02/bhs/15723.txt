{@santika@}¦, adj. (= Pali id., stem in comp.; cf. next;
MIndic for {@sāntika@}, q.v.; {@sa-@}, q.v., plus Skt. antika, as
adj. Gr. Lex.), {%near%}: evaṃrūpāḥ sattvāḥ nirvāṇa-°kā bha-
vanti Mv ii.287.14; santikāvacara (= Pali id.), {%living near%}
[Page556-a+ 71]
(with gen.): bhagavato upasthāyakaṃ (acc. sg.) bhaga-
vataḥ °raṃ bhagavato saṃmukhaṃ Mv iii.49.13. The form
{@sāntika@}, tho very likely a secondary Sktization of this,
seems to support the above theory of its origin; it is not
connected with {@santa(ka)@} as has been held by some (e.g.
Senart, see next).
