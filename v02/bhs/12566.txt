{@ratikara@}¦, m., ({@1@}) {%lamp%} (? possibly a corruption for
some other word of that mg.; this mg. is proved by
Burnouf, Introd. 223 infra, where in a transl. of a verse
recension of Kv it is a {%lamp%} which gives the merchant
Siṃhala(rāja) the information which in the prose Kv he
receives from a ratikara; no plausible em. occurs to me):
Kv 54.7; 55.7, 9, 12 (warns the merchant that he is in
danger of being devoured by an ogress); ({@2@}) m., n. of a
samādhi: Mvy 545; ŚsP 1418.11. Cf. {@ratiṃkara@}.
