{@? oṣita@}¦, in RP 19.10 (vs) apy oṣitā āmiṣapātracīvare
(so apparently divide), {%set upon, intent upon worldly things%}
(like) {%bowl and robe%} (see {@āmiṣa@}). Cf. Pali an-osita, {%not%}
{%occupied%} (of houses; CPD). If correct, oṣita seems = Skt.
avasita; used with loc. But api at the beginning is sus-
picious, and s does not normally become ṣ after MIndic
o for ava. I suspect corruption.
