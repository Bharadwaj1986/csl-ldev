{@Maitrīya@}¦, in Kv 2.2 the last of a rather short list
of Bodhisattvas; we should expect the name of {@Maitreya@}
(1) here, and probably the text has a mere error or mis-
print for it. More curious however is Divy 326.9--11 eṣa
eva devate sa (separate from the next) pṛṣṭhībhūto Mai-
trīyo yo vyāghryā ātmānaṃ parityajya catvāriṃśatkal-
pasaṃprasthito Maitreyo bodhisattva ekena śiraḥparityā-
genāvapṛṣṭhīkṛtaḥ; here, if the text is correct, Maitrīya
would seem to be the name of Maitreya in an earlier birth;
but the passage is otherwise puzzling. On the basis of
these two passages should we recognize Maitrīya as a real
variant (like {@Maitraka@}, q.v.) for {@Maitreya@} (1)?
