{@khaṇḍa, (1)@}¦ m., seems to be used not at the end of
cpds. in the sense of {%quantity, mass, large number%} (as in
Skt.), but in apposition to the noun, as separate word,
if we may trust the reading: ye cānye parvatāḥ khaṇḍāḥ
(2 mss. cited as puṣṭāḥ, ghuṣṇāḥ) SP 355.6, {%and whatever%}
{%other mountains there are, quantities of them%} (?); ({@2@}) n. of
the chief minister of a king of Videha: MSV ii.3.17 ff.
