{@mātāpitṛ@}¦, sg. or pl. (not otherwise noted in this
sense), {%family, relatives, ‘home-folks’%}: (a king has granted
a wish to a courtesan, his concubine; she replies) Mv
i.348.16--17 mahārāja yāvatā khu mātāpitaraṃ āpṛcchāmi
tato devasya sakāśāto varaṃ yācayiṣyāmi. tāye mātāpitṝ-
ṇāṃ ārocitam. (18--349.1) tehi dāni yaṃ mataṃ so taṃ
jalpati…tahiṃ aparā parivrājikā (2) paṇḍitā…sā
āha: Jenti, tvaṃ vailāsikāye dhītā…It is obvious that
a plurality of persons is meant here, and certainly not
the ‘mother and father’ of Jentī. On this basis I think
it likely that in LV 279.11 mātāpitṛsaṃjñino means
{%regarding%} (each other) {%as members of the same family%}:
(sarvasattvāś ca tasmin samaye maitracittā hitacittāḥ)
parasparaṃ mātā° ‘bhūvan. Cf. next.
