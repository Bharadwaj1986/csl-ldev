{@anigha@}¦, adj. (= Pali id., also anīgha), {%free from evil%}
(? see {@nigha, nīgha@}); occurs chiefly (in Pali literature,
aside from commentarial etymologies, only) in the neg.
form; ep. of Buddha, or at least of perfected saints. In
Pali often rendered {%calm, unperturbed%}, but it seems that
{%free from evil%} (whether {%sin%}, pāpa, or {%misery%}, duḥkha) will
suffice in all Pali and BHS occurrences. Regularly in lists
of formulaic epithets which give little clue to a more
precise mg.: LV 358.5; Mv ii.397.16; iii.400.2 (same vs
in Pali Sn 534 with anigha); 418.14; Ud xxix.34; Gv
284.6.
