{@utkāsa, (1)@}¦ (m.), {%clearing of the throat%} (= Skt. ut-
kāsana): LV 416.11 (vs) utkāsaśabdu napi śrūyati tan-
muhūrtaṃ (mss. vary greatly, but Tib. lud paḥi sgra
confirms this form and mg.); ({@2@}) m. utkāsaḥ, see s.v.
{@utkāśa@}; if the theory there stated be rejected, the word
would have to be classed with (1) and would seem to
mean something like {%hemming and hawing%}, or rather
{%ominous sound%} (calling attention to the future disap-
pearance of the dharma), in Gv 307.23.
