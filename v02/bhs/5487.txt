[? {@khalli(n)@}¦, obscure and corrupt: SP 351.5 (vs) so
dṛṣṭva teṣāṃ ca jarām upasthitāṃ, valī ca khallī (so KN
em., mss. khalī, unmetr.; WT khaṇḍaṃ with their ms. Ḱ)
ca śiraś ca pāṇḍaram, {%seeing…their wrinkles…and%}
{%gray head(s)%}. Tib. seems to have no equivalent of the
crucial word: mgo la skra dkar gñer ma kun byuṅ ste,
{%(them) having become all with white hair on the head and%}
{%wrinkles%}. A noun seems to be required for this word; if
khaṇḍaṃ is the true reading, perhaps it could mean
something like {%decrepitude%}.]
