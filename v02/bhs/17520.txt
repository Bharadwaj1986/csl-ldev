{@syāt, siyāti@}¦ (as in Pali, AMg. siyā; in only Jain Skt.,
see BR), {%perhaps%}; common at end of Jātaka stories, usually:
syāt khalu (punar) bhikṣavaḥ yuṣmākam (rarely omitted)
evam asyā (or asyāt), {%it may be, however, monks, that you%}
{%may have the idea…%}, Mv ii.64.2; 68.13; 72.4, 8, 10;
81.17; 83.7; 89.1, 3, 6; 94.5, 8; 113.16; 114.3; 176.15;
219.4; iii.76.18, and often in Mv; so in Mv i.45.1, 5, 8, 11,
read siyāti (§ 29.41; Senart siyā ti) punar…evam asya
syāt; yasyeha pariśeṣaṃ syān (so mss. ii.3.7, in i.199.9
syā) nārīye (°yo) jīvitaṃ bhavet Mv i.199.9 = ii.3.7 (vs),
{%of what woman there may be perchance remaining in this%}
{%world a life%} (of ten months and seven days); Senart reads
syā in both places and takes it for the pronoun asyāḥ,
which seems to me impossible (§ 21.84).
