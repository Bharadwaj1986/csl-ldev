{@lumba@}¦, a kind of tree, acc. to Senart (who em. thus
for mss. {@lamba@}) the {%plakṣa%}, in lumbodyānaṃ Mv i.99.6
(vs), applied to what is otherwise known as the {@Lumbinī@}
grove; since in line 8 {@lumbinī@} (q.v., 2) seems to be a tree-
name, the em. seems plausible, tho no other record of
lumba (or {@lamba@}) or lumbinī as a tree-name has been
noted.
