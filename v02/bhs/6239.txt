1 {@citta@}¦ (= Pali id., also citra, = AMg. citta, = Skt.
caitra), n. of the first month of spring (as usually reckoned,
but here called ‘the first month of summer’, evidently
implying a division of the year into only three seasons,
spring-summer constituting one season of four months;
see Senart's note): grīṣmāṇa māse prathame cittasmiṃ
(so, or cittesmiṃ, mss.; Senart em. caitrasmiṃ) Mv
i.294.3 (vs).
