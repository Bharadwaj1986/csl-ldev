{@kṛtya, (1)@}¦ m., a kind of demon (cf. Skt. kṛtyā, of
which this may be a masc. correspondent created for the
nonce, in this passage which is a list of masc. evil spirits):
SP 401.5--6 kṛtyo vā vetāḍo vā…(6) yakṣakṛtyo vāmanu-
ṣyakṛtyo vā manuṣyakṛtyo vā; ({@2@}) nt., or at end of adj.
cpds., {%business%} etc., in some cases apparently transcending
normal Skt. usage; bhakta-kṛtya (= Pali bhatta-kicca),
lit. {%business of food%}, so {%a meal%}: Divy 185.22 °tyaṃ kartum
ārabdhaḥ; āhāra-kṛtya, id., Divy 82.26 nānenāhāreṇāhāra-
kṛtyaṃ kariṣyati, {%he will not make his meal(s) on this food%},
i.e. live on this alone; Divy 236.6, text āhāraṃ (read
°ra-?) kṛtyaṃ kuru, {%get your sustenance%}; acc. to Senart,
note on Mv i.349.18 (p. 622), used like the Pkt. quasi-
suffix -kera(ka) as substantial equivalent of gen. case-
ending (Pkt. -kera is to be derived from Skt. kārya with
Pischel 176; see {@-keraka@}); Senart's Index further inter-
prets -kṛtye ii.97.13 as ‘periphrasis for instrumental’, but
this is certainly wrong, since there gītakṛtye pramattā
jaladardarake ca clearly means {%careless in their occupation%}
{%with singing and the%} (musical instrument) {%jaladardaraka%};
the cases where -kṛtya is alleged to be a ‘periphrasis for
the gen.’ are also, in some cases, doubtful; in Mv i.349.18
and 350.1 Senart rāja-kṛtyā kośāto, supposedly = {%from%}
{%the king's treasury%}, but the mss. read rāja-kṛto or (v.l.
in 349.18) °kṛtāto, and the latter, at least, could be inter-
preted ({%the treasury made by the king%}); ii.95.4 rājakṛtyato
(abl.; v.l. °tāṃ) odhṛtabhāro, {%having laid down the burden%}
{%of%} (lit. {%from, away from%}) {%royal duty%}; in ii.446.14 rājakṛtye
siṃhāsane rājeti kṛtva (°tvä?) upaviśāpito, {%he%} (who was
actually not the king) {%was caused to sit upon the throne%}
{%which was appropriate%} (really belonged) {%to the king%}; ii.478.10
rājakṛtye (v.l. °kṛte) mahānase, and 12 rājakṛtyehi sūpehi,
as in prec.; Senart's interpretation may however be
substantially correct in the last three, and in ii.113.9
rājakṛtyaṃ udyānaṃ, {%the park that belonged to the king%}.
Since Skt. kṛtya is in fact a synonym of kārya in some
of its uses, the comparison with Pkt. -kera(ka), from Skt.
kārya, is apposite. But the two alleged parallels from LV
cited by Senart in his note, above, are not sound; one
rests on a false reading of the Calcutta ed., and the other
is to be interpreted otherwise. ({@3@}) -kṛtya, -kṛtyaṃ, =
{@-kṛtvā@} for Skt. -kṛtvas, q.v.
