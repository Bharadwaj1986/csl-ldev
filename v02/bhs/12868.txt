<L>12868<pc>457,2<k1>रोदित<k2>रोदित
{@? rodita@}¦ (nt.), {%lamentation%}, acc. to Senart's much
emended text in Mv i.68.8 (vs); the form roditehi is well
supported, but perh. originally stood for roditāhi, adj.
with following pramadāhi of mss. (for which Senart em.
mathitā hi-, very violently). The orig. from of the passage
defies reconstruction.
