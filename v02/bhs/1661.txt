{@abhisaṃskāra@}¦, m. (cited from Skt. only BR 7.1700,
from Caraka; essentially a Buddhist word; = Pali abhisaṃ-
khāra; see {@°skaroti, °skṛta@}), {%performance, accomplishment%}:
SP 226.9 (udāraṃ dharmābhi°, {%noble performance of%}
{%dharma%}); in all meanings often made object of the cognate
verb {@°skaroti@}, as Dbh 55.8--9 pāramitābhisaṃskāraṃ
cābhisaṃskaroti, {%and accomplishes the accomplishment of the%}
{%Pāramitās%}; Dbh 22.23 {%performances%}; Bbh 256.25 na
vyañjanābhisaṃskārārthī, {%not seeking the accomplishment%}
{%of the letter%} (but of the spirit, the true esoteric meaning,
arthārthī); often ṛddhyabhi° (= Pali iddhābhi°) {%perform-%}
{%ance of magic%}, SP 300.9; 388.6; Divy 161.11; 190.22; 340.11;
Jm 11.6; 153.2; object of the verb °skaroti, {%perform a%}
{%magic performance%}, LV 182.14; 290.13 f.; Samādh 19.14--15;
Av i.24.3; {%performance%} of action, Samādh 22.2 (here
specified as karmābhi°), generally with special reference
to its fruits, good or bad, esp. when modified by, or cpd.
with, words like puṇya, apuṇya, kuśala, pāpa(ka), the Pali
equivalents of which are similarly used; here abhi° often
may be rendered {%accumulation, piling up%} (of merit or
demerit), and abhisaṃskaroti {%accumulates%}; cf. LV 88.17
pāpakān abhisaṃskārān abhisaṃskariṣyanti with Dbh
48.7 puṇyāpuṇyāneñjyān abhisaṃskārān upacinvanti,
(ignorant persons) {%accumulate%} (upa-ci, unambiguous!)
{%performances%} (or accumulations, of karman) {%that are%}
{%meritorious, demeritorious%}, or {%leading to immovable states%}
(see {@aneñjya@}), suggesting that the LV passage means
really {%will accumulate evil accumulations%} (of karman); so
also LV 398.18 duḥkhābhisaṃskāra-mala-{%impurity due to%}
{%the accumulation%} (hardly {%performance!%}) {%of miseries%} (thru
karman); puṇyābhi° and kuśalābhi° together, SP 333.3;
348.11; Suv 83.3; puṇyābhi° also SP 337.4; 414.13; AsP
346.8; apuṇyābhi° LV 88.10; kuśalābhi° Śikṣ 190.16;
cittābhisaṃskāra, {%accomplishment of%} (proper) {%thoughts%} or
{%state of mind, right mental make up%}, Divy 90.26 ayaṃ
pradīpas tayā dārikayā mahatā cittābhisaṃskāreṇa
prajvalito (this gives the flame magic power of persistence);
same without citta, Mv iii.391.8--9 parivrājikā…visṛṣṭena
svareṇābhisaṃskāreṇa ({%with mental preparation%} or {%con-%}
{%centration, application of mind, fixed determination%}) svā-
dhyāyaṃ karontī; Mv ii.126.7 sādhu ca suṣṭhu ca abhisaṃ-
skāreṇa, {%with careful mental preparation, application, deter-%}
{%mination%} (here, to rise up after having fallen down; and
so ii.127.11; 128.16; 130.1--2; the situation is the same as
in LV 254.21 where abhisaṃskurvaṃs occurs, see {@°ska-@}
{@roti@}); see {@sābhisaṃskāra@}, in which abhi° comes close to
this shade of mg.
