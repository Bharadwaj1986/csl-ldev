{@pratyupāsana@}¦ (nt.; no cpd. of ās- with praty-upa-
is recorded anywhere; one might think of em. to {@paryupā°@},
q.v., but in Pkt. this appears as AMg. etc. pajjuvāsa-,
whereas pratyup° would give *paccuv°; hence such an
em. could not easily be based on the Pkt. confusion of
paḍi-with pari-, § 2.47), {%service, waiting upon%}: °na-vaine-
yānām Gv 348.26.
