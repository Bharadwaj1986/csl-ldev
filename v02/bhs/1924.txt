<L>1924<pc>066,1<k1>अर्तियति<k2>अर्(त्)तियति
{@ar(t)tiyati@}¦ or {@°tīyati, °te@}; in one doubtful passage
perhaps ārtī°, otherwise always art° when not fused in
saṃdhi with preceding vowel; forms occurring include
ar(t)tīyati, °yanti, °tīyate, °tiyante, °tīyanto and °taṃ
(pres. pple.), aritīyeran (! read art°), artita (ppp.); also
ārtīyate (? v.l. attī°); attīyantā (and probably attīyate
for prec.); ṛtīyate, °yante, °yamāna (pres. pple.; for ṛt°
we usually find rit° written); ardīyamāna (pres. pple.);
āstīryati; and noun {@attīyanā@}. The corresp. Pali (see CPD)
is written aṭṭīyati, aṭṭhī°, aḍḍhī°, addiyati. Despite all
this confusion, there is no doubt that we are dealing with
essentially one word, with modifications due to diverse
influences, including popular etymology and hyper-Sktism.
Wogihara, ZDMG 58.454, gives the ‘correct form’ as
ṛtīyate (which, or rather usually rit°, is customary in Bbh,
but I believe occurs nowhere else), and the mg. as {%er%}
{%schämt sich%}; both statements are wrong, I believe. As to
mg., Wogihara was evidently influenced by the fact that
the word is often associated in Pali with harāyati, jiguc-
chati, and in BHS with jehrīyate, (vi)jugupsati, or equiv-
alents. But it is also often used where {%shame%} cannot be
involved. Most likely the MIndic word is a denominative
from ārti (for which arti, with semi-MIndic shortening,
is recorded even in Skt.). All forms are included here since
the word is clearly a unit, but they are also entered under
the several heading: ({@1@}) {%is grieved, perturbed, distressed%}:
Mv i.219.17 = ii.21.19 kecit saṃsārapāśena arttiyante
(ii.21.19 saṃsāracāreṇa artīyanti) yathā aham (said by
the infant Bodhisattva), {%are distressed%}; Mv ii.161.7 bo-
dhisattvo jātīye arttīyanto, {%being pained by%} (or, {%on ac-%}
{%count of%}) {%birth%}, 11--12…maraṇena artt°, 13 śokehi artt°;
Mv ii.242.13 arttīyati (Senart em. attī°); Mv i.89.18
(ākīrṇavihāreṇa) nārtīyanti; Mv ii.480.7 śokārtita; LV
[Page066-b+ 71]
174.14 jarārtita; Bbh 166.11 ṛtīyamānaḥ (of a Bodhisattva);
Bbh 171.9 ritīyamānaṃ. ({@2@}) In some transitional cases,
leading over to the next group, the additional note of
{%aversion, revulsion%} seems more or less clearly present:
Bbh 282.7--8 tena pūrvakeṇādhimokṣeṇāritīyeran (read
°ṇārtīyeran; but in same phrase line 23 °mokṣeṇa ritīyante),
{%they would be annoyed by, sick of, disgusted with their for-%}
{%mer enthusiasm%}; Bbh 168.23 ritīyate; Mvy 1830 nārtīyate
(no context); ({@3@}) like preceding but accompanied by
parallel forms of hrī-, jugups-, or the like: SP 108.6
daridracintayārtīyantaṃ jehrīyamāṇaṃ jugupsamānaṃ,
{%distressed, ashamed, disgusted by the thought of being poor%};
Mv i.343.1 (tena adharmeṇa) attīyantā (Senart em. artī°)
vijigupsantā or °satā (mss. °satāṃ, evidently pres. pple.,
Senart em. wrongly °sitā) {%distressed and disgusted by this%}
{%immorality%}; Karmav 47.26 āstīryati jihreti vigarhati
vijugupsati, {%is distressed, ashamed, offended, disgusted%} (by
acts he has done); 49.2; Divy 39.7 ye 'nena pūtikāyen-
ārdīyamānā jehrīyante vijugupsamānāḥ, {%being distressed,%}
{%are ashamed, disgusted%}; ({@4@}) with abl., {%feels aversion%} (from):
MadhK 297.2, text ārtīyate (ebhyo dharmebhyo), but v.l.
attīyate, so prob. read; followed by jehrīyate vitarati
vijugupsate; in line 4 below (see note 1) mss. dharmebhyo
attīyanā (text artī°) vijugupsanā (nouns).
