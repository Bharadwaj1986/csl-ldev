{@kṣaṇika@}¦, adj., {%empty%} (of the hands): read in Mv
ii.252.14 kṣaṇikena (Senart °tena with 1 ms., v.l. kṣami-
kena) hastena gṛhaṃ gacchati, hato bhavati, {%went home%}
{%empty-handed and was depressed%} (of a fowler who caught
no birds); iii.171.6, read svakaṃ ca hastaṃ kṣaṇikaṃ (so
1 ms., v.l. kṣeṇikaṃ; Senart em. implausibly) paśyati
(having given away a beautiful lotus, and now regretting
the gift); repeated 171.9. Is this an extension of the mg.
of JM. khaṇika, {%idle, unemployed, out of work%} (which is
itself derived from Skt. kṣaṇin, {%at leisure%})? In any case
the two Mv passages confirm each other; kṣaṇika is
certainly the true form in both, and the mg. is certain.
