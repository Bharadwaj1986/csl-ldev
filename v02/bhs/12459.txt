{@yāna@}¦, nt. (sometimes with m. endings), {%vehicle%}, as
in Skt. and Pali; in Pali also used of the 8-fold Noble
Path, as the {%vehicle%} to salvation; by extension of this use,
in BHS applied to the two vehicles ({@mahā°, hīna°@}), or
three, with pratyeka(buddha)-yāna between the two;
that is, {%religious methods%}, within the fold of Buddhism.
See SP 75.11, 76.2 ff. (parable of the burning house, the
3 yānas compared to {%carts%} of different sizes); for mahā-y°
synonyms are buddha-y°, bodhisattva-y°, eka-y° (because,
SP 40.13 f. says, this is really the {%only vehicle%}, na kiṃcic…
dvitīyaṃ vā tṛtīyaṃ vā yānaṃ saṃvidyate); eka-y° also
Mvy 1255; {@agra-yāna@}, q.v., id.; triyānam ekayānaṃ ca
Laṅk 155.14; the 3 yānas mentioned, but not named,
Mv ii.362.8 f., where it is specifically stated that one can
attain parinirvāṇa by any of them, and no preference is
expressed; in SP 43.7 (in times of corruption, the Tathā-
gatas) upāyakauśalyena tad evaikaṃ buddhayānaṃ
triyānanirdeśena nirdiśanti; synonym of hīna-y° is also
{@śrāvaka-y°@}; see the various terms, also {@nava-(acira-)-@}
{@yāna-saṃprasthita@}.
