{@? dāmaka@}¦, possibly adj. (from Skt. dāman), {%garlanded,%}
{%formed into garlands%} (of flowers), in paryaṅkaṃ dāmaka-
[Page264-a+ 71]
puṣpa-saṃnibhaṃ Mv ii.183.16 (vs); so Senart reads, but
assumes inverted order of parts of cpd., = puṣpa-dāmaka-,
{%like a garland of flowers%}; if the reading is right, perhaps
{%like flowers that form a garland%}. But the text is an em.
and quite uncertain; mss. damakaṃ or °ko. In the follow-
ing line bhāryāṃ ca sadṛśī devīm, understand sadṛśī =
°śīṃ, as separate word, {%corresponding, suitable%}.
