{@purusakāra-@}¦ (= Skt.), in °ra-phalam, one of the 5
{@phala@} (q.v.): Mvy 2274; sc. of karuṇā acc. to Sūtrāl.
xvii.31, comm., {%fruit consisting of heroic deed, because it%}
{%brings happiness to others and penance%} (austerity, tapas)
{%to oneself%}, reading in text and comm. tāpaka instead of
tāyaka, with Lévi's note in transl., but Lévi's transl.
({%qui éclaire le Moi%}) seems clearly wrong; it brings pain to
oneself, pleasure only to others; tapas surely cannot mean
{%illumination%}; it is this quality which makes it {%heroic%}; in
more general sense Bbh 102.17, expl. 103.1--5, puruṣa-
kāreṇa yadi vā kṛṣyā…sasyādikaṃ lābhādikaṃ ca
phalam abhinirvartayati…
