{@tatprathamatas@}¦, adv. (cf. AMg. tappaḍhamayā,
{%priority%}; if such a cpd. occurs in Pali I have not found
it in PTSD or Childers), {%for the first time%}: °taḥ śalākāṃ
gṛhṇatāṃ Divy 44.28; °to Buddhadarśanam 47.6; tadā
mama gṛhe tatp° piṇḍapātaḥ paribhoktavya iti 188.24;
ādikarmikaṃ tatprathamakarmikam (see prec.) tatpra-
thamata evam avavadati Bbh 395.2. In several of these,
notably the last, tat could certainly not be interpreted
as an independent word.
