{@sadāmatta, (1)@}¦ m. pl. (= Pali id., but rare and
usually not in corresponding lists), n. of a class of godlings
(yakṣas, Mv i.30.8), associated with and functioning like
{@karoṭapāṇi@} and {@mālādhāra@}, qq.v.; also {@°taka@} and
{@sadāmāda@}, qq.v.: Mv i.30.8; Divy 218.9, 30 ff.; Mmk
19.13; 43.18; 232.10; Mahāsamāj. Waldschmidt Kl. Skt.
Texte 4, 187.5; ({@2@}) nt.sg., n. of a mythical city (= Divy
{@°mattaka@}, q.v.): Av i.201.6; 203.1; = Pali id., Jāt. i.363.11
= iii.207.2, in same vs as Av i.203.1; in Pali seems to be
misinterpreted as a palace (pāsāda) by the comm. and
transl. (the comm. in fact alleges that the word means
lit. {%silver%}), but the full story as told in both Av and Divy
(not found in the Jātakas which are truncated) shows
that a city is meant.
