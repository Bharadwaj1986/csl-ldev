{@bheraṇḍa(ka), bheruṇḍaka@}¦, m. (Pali bheraṇḍaka,
{%jackal%} acc. to Jāt. comm. v.276.9; the form bheruṇḍa,
cited by Burnouf, Lotus 371, is read bheruṇḍaka in our
SP, and has, doubtless by chance, not been noted else-
where in BHS), some sort of beast of prey which makes
a terrible sound (Mv ii.140.15 °ḍa-bhairava [mss. bhīrava,
bhīruva]-ruteṣu; iii.123.9; 264.12) and eats human flesh
(SP 83.11; 85.13); Tib. renders variously, on Mvy 4785
spyaṅ ({%wolf%}) or ce spyaṅ ({%jackal%}, acc. to Das also {%fox%});
on SP 83.11 ce spyaṅ, on 85.13 and 86.12 lce spyaṅ (=
ce spyaṅ); on LV 306.6 wa ({%fox%}, but cf. wa spyaṅ, {%jackal%});
the word śṛgāla, {%jackal%}, is prob. a different animal, since
it is closely associated with our word in LV 306.6; SP
83.11 and 86.12; in LV, where Tib. wa renders our word,
śṛgāla is rendered by ce spyaṅ, while in the two SP passages
the reverse is the case, wa rendering śṛgāla! Kern on SP
renders {%hyena%}, a plausible guess. Forms: bheraṇḍa Mv
ii.140.15; °ḍaka Mv iii.123.9 (both vss); bheruṇḍaka Mvy
4785; Mv iii.264.12 (prose); SP 83.11; 85.13; 86.12 (all
vss); LV 306.6 (prose). In Deśīn. 6.108 bheruṇḍa is defined
dīvī (= dvīpin; comm. citrakaḥ); the hyena is ‘spotted’,
as well as the leopard.
