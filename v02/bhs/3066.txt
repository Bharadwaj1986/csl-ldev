{@āsa@}¦, m. (only known in Vedic cpd. sv-āsa-stha), {%seat%}:
Gv 474.18 (vs) śūrāṇa teṣam ayam āsu (n. sg.) sudur-
jayānām, {%this is the seat of those heroes…%} Meter does not
permit emendation to āvāsa, which is used in parallel
lines 2, 10, etc.; other parallels vihāra; all three are virtual
synonyms. Prakritic contraction of āvāsa to āsa is im-
probable. For āsa = aṃśa see {@maitrāsa-tā@}.
