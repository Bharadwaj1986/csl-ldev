{@abhijñā@}¦ (= Pali abhiññā), {%higher or supernatural%}
{%knowledge; intuition%} (CPD). There are 5 or 6, in both Pali
and BHS, agreeing in essence tho the order and precise
forms of the names vary. In Dharmas 20, five: divyacakṣus,
divyaśrotra, paracittajñāna, pūrvanivāsānusmṛti, ṛddhi;
in Mvy 201--209 six, same order, with variant forms,
(parasya) {@cetaḥ-@} (citta-)-{@paryāya-@} (q.v.)-jñāna, for the
third; the sixth is āśravakṣayajñāna, as in Pali and else-
where when 6 are named; the fifth is ṛddhividhijñāna in
Mvy 208; SP 134.11 lists 5, practically as in Dharmas
except that the fifth is ṛddhivimokṣakriyā, an unusual
phrase, for which no v.l. is given in KN or WT; Burnouf
(Lotus App. XIV, p. 821) cites his ms. as reading ṛddhi-
sākṣātkriyā, which is much more plausible. Twenty
abhijñā-karmāṇi are set forth in detail Mvy 210--230.
In Laṅk 292.13--16 the abhijñā, collectively, are classified
as to their origin in four ways (in l. 16 read with Suzuki
Transl. 242 n. 1 te 'bhijñā na vipākajāḥ). References to
{%five%} abhijñā: SP 12.4; 141.9; 254.14; Mv i.284.3; ii.33.11;
in ii.96.1 attributed to brahmanical, non-Buddhist {%ṛṣis%};
Divy 321.3; Śikṣ 243.13 (read pañco, see p. 412, note) etc.;
{%six%}, SP 90.7; 129.10; 150.2; 155.2; 255.4; 272.6; Mv iii.55.5
ff.; Divy 399.27, etc.; note Mv i.165.12 where ‘by abhijñā’
(abhijñāye) the Buddha attains knowledge of the Doctrine
taught of old by other Buddhas; this certainly does not
mean {%memory%}, cf. s.v. {@abhijānāti@}, which is commonly but
wrongly rendered {%remembers%} in similar contexts; mahā-
bhijñā- SP 66.8.
