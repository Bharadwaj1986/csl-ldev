{@avakara@}¦, m., prob. read with Index and Mironov
{@avakāra@}, rendered by Tib. ḥgod pa, perhaps {%arrangement,%}
{%placement, ordering%}, or the like: Mvy 571 samākṣarāvakaro
(°kāro) nāma samādhiḥ. No v.l. in either ed. But ŚsP
[Page069-b+ 71]
1421.3 (from which, or an allied text, Mvy cites) reads
samākṣarākāro, explaining: sarvasamādhīnāṃ samākṣara-
tāṃ pratilabhate. This seems to fit the reading °kṣarākāra,
and definitely does not fit the apparent meaning of {@ava-@}
{@kāra@}, q.v. Yet in another list ŚsP 1413.15 reads °kṣarā-
vakāra.
