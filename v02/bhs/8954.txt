{@parikalpa@}¦, m. (not in Skt., except rarely Jain Skt.,
see Schmidt, Nachträge, where it is rendered {%Täuschung%};
Pali parikappa, acc. to PTSD {%assumption, supposition,%}
{%surmise%}; once, Therag. 940, said to mean {%preparation,%}
{%intention, strategem%}, but at least as possible would be
{%vain, false imaginings%} for parikappehi there), fundamentally
({@1@}) {%surmise, assumption, hypothesis, figment of imagination%},
regularly with implication of falsity or unreliability (cf.
{@parikalpayati@}); sometimes of an innocent {%hypothesis%} or
frankly {%imaginary assumption%}: parikalpam upādāya Śikṣ
87.15, 16; 166.11, {%assuming a hypothetical case, to take an%}
{%imaginary hypothesis%}; but chiefly with derogatory impli-
cation, {%vain fancy%}, as something to be got rid of; often
with {@kalpa@} and {@vikalpa@}, qq.v.; sarva-kalpa-vikalpa-
parikalpa-prahāṇāya LV 34.11; na kalpo na vikalpo na
parikalpaḥ Śikṣ 272.7; kalpavikalpa-parikalpa- KP 94.3
[Page321-a+ 71]
(prose; Tib. omits the equivalent of parik°, doubtless by
haplography); parikalpa-saṃjña-vigatā(ḥ) Gv 478.8 (vs);
(avikalpe bodhisattvajñānamaṇḍale) sarva-kalpa-parikalpā
na saṃvidyate (= °yante; read so ?) Gv 350.6; sukham
atra (sc. gṛhāvāse) kutaḥ kathaṃ kadā vā parikalpa-
praṇayaṃ na ced upaiti Jm 108.6, {%whence, how, and when%}
{%could there be happiness in this%} (householder's life), {%if%}
(as has been shown in the prec. vs) {%it does not come to one%}
{%who is devoted to vain imaginings ?%} (otherwise Speyer);
abhūta-(q.v.)-parikalpa- Laṅk 38.4; abhūta-parikalpa-
samutthitaś ca Suv 58.1 (said of the body), {%arisen from%}
{%unreal imaginings%}; -parikalpa-samutthita- Gv 466.21;
parikalpa-samucchrita LV 174.8 (vs), {%produced by vain%}
{%imaginings%}, said of kāmaguṇāḥ, which are called māya-
marīci-samā(ḥ) and the like in the same vs; parikalpa-
samucchritaḥ (Mironov -samutthitaḥ) Mvy 7423; Tib. here
yoṅs su rtogs pa, and regularly so or with rtog (pa) for rtogs
(pa), as in Suv 58.1 and LV 34.11 (but in LV 174.8 rtogs);
this is a woodenly literal rendering; yoṅs su = pari,
while kalpa is rendered rtog(s pa), defined {%consider, reflect,%}
{%discern, perceive, understand%} (the distinction between rtog
and rtogs which Jä. sets up is clearly not maintained in
the texts); the derogatory connotation is recognized s.v.
rtog pa by Jä. and Das, yet Das erroneously renders the
cpd. yoṅs su rtogs pa las byuṅ ba, ‘{%having arisen from quite%}
{%reliable information%} (parikalpa-samucchriti)’; vikalpa is
rendered rnam par rtog(s) pa; ({@2@}) nt. or m., {%prose version%}
{%of a jātaka%} or {%legend%}; four times in colophons of Mv, always
at the end of prose accounts; in the first three followed
by verse accounts of the same story: parikalpa-padaṃ
Mv ii.181.3; samāptaṃ śyāmakajātakasya parikalpaṃ
219.17; samāptaṃ hastinikājātakasya parikalpaṃ iii.133.5;
padumāvatīye parikalpo samāpto (v.l. °paṃ samāptaṃ)
170.10 (here not followed by any version in verse).
