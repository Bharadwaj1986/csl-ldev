{@biḍāla-bhastrā@}¦ (or {@°tra@}, or, MIndic, {@°ta, °tā@}; = Pali
biḷāra-bhastā), lit. {%cat-bag%}, acc. to comm. ii.101.29 on
Pali MN i.128.21 {%catskin-bag%} (biḷāracammapasibbako);
as in Pali used as symbol of something very soft: so read
(mss. somewhat corrupt; Senart °trasta, in ignorance of
the Pali parallel) in Mv ii.261.2, °trā- (or °tra, °ta, °tā)-
sama-cittatāṃ, and in repetition 262.3, where perhaps
some other word (bhoga, {%delight, pleasure?%}) was inserted
after this word in the cpd.
