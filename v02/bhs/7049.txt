{@telā@}¦, a high number: Gv 106.9. Cf. prec., and {@bhelā@},
which occurs in the same context with this. There are
three sets of numbers in -el- preceded by various con-
sonants; in one set the stem-vowel a is added, in another
ā, in another u. The t- and bh-forms of Mvy seem dup-
lications of each other, but both appear in one Gv version
(106.9 and 11), viz. the one ending in ā.
