{@Puṣkarasārin, (1)@}¦ n. of a brahman, ruler of the
droṇamukha {@Utkaṭa@}, q.v.: Divy 620.11 ff. As suggested
in DPPN, prob. identical with Pali Pokkhara-sāti or
°sādi, dwelling in Ukkaṭṭhā; but the Divy story about
him seems not paralleled in Pali. See also s.v. {@Pūraśāyin;@}
{@(2)@} n. of a king of Taxila, app. = Pali Pukkusāti: MSV
ii.26.12 ff.; 31.15 ff.
