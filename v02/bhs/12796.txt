{@riñcati@}¦ (Pali id., Skt. riṇakti), {%leaves, empties%}, in
special sense, with object buddhakṣetra; gods address
pratyekabuddhas when the Bodhisattva is about to
descend to earth for his last incarnation: riñcatha buddha-
kṣetraṃ Mv i.197.1, 4; 357.4, 6; riñcata mārṣā buddha-
kṣetraṃ LV 18.12; {%empty the buddha-field%}, sc. by entering
nirvāṇa, so that there will be no Buddha (not even a
Pratyeka-b.) in the ‘field’ when the Bodhisattva enters it.
(The mg. {%neglects, ignores%}, seems supported in Skt. tho
perh. commoner in Pali, and in BHS: RP 34.12 [read
riñcitvā]; Bbh 396.20; AsP 243.6.)
