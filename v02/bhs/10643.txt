mg. {%abandonment%} is manifestly impossible (tho Foucaux
tries to adopt it in LV, by flagrant violation of the text),
and {%exertion%} in the sense of Pali padhāna seems certainly
implausible. The word is very common in AMg. in this
mg.; note that BHS has usually this AMg.-like form for
Pali padhāna.
