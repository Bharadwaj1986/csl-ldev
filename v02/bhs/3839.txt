{@upahāra@}¦, m. (nt. once; = Skt., Pali, Pkt. id.), fun-
damentally {%gift%}, (loving) {%present%}, in BHS as elsewhere;
e.g. (with change of gender) Av i.378.2 (prose) sarvopa-
hārāṇi copaḍhaukitāni.In a Mv passage beginning i.177.13
used repeatedly in a somewhat peculiar way which misled
Senart, who in two notes (i.518 f., 523 f.) offers three
different interpretations, all wrong (the passage cited 519
from SP contains a false reading; the SP ed. 476.5--6 does
not contain the word cited by Senart, not even as a v.l.).
In this Mv passage, the word applies to various acts by
which the Buddha miraculously intervenes to save some-
one from an intended grievous sin or to convert him from
a dangerously false heresy. It should be rendered by some-
thing like (kindly or compassionate) {%favor, gift, beneficial%}
{%service%}: Mv i.177.13--15 introduces the detailed stories of
specific acts called upahāra thus: paropahārāṃś ca…
