{@pāricaryā@}¦, or (MIndic) {@°cariyā@} (= Pali pāricariyā;
see also {@paricaryā@}), {%service%}: upasthitā (mss. °to) pāri-
caryāye (instr. sg.) santo Mv i.286.2 (vs), so mss., Senart
em. paricariyāye, which if final e be read short corrects
the meter; in Mv ii.225.2 Senart pāricaryāye, but see the
readings of the mss.; meter would be better if we read
tāṃ guru-su-paricariyāya (all supported by one ms. or
the other except that both read °caryāya) but the rest
of the line is defective; Senart's reading is bad; pāricaryā
Mv iii.348.9 (prose); -pāricariyāye 348.13 (vs), so Senart
em. m.c., mss. -pari°.
