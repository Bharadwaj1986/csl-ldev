{@? Rodha@}¦, acc. to Lefm.'s text, n. of a former Buddha:
LV 171.17; Calc. and Foucaux, by diff. word-division,
read Nirodha; Tib. seems to read gsal, usually {%distinct,%}
{%clear, bright, glorious%} (= {@Roca?@} q.v.), which seems inappro-
priate to either; text perh. corrupt, but no v.l. However,
the syllable -ni surely belongs with the prec. word, -pradāni
(for °ne), cf. dāni 19, 20, 22.
