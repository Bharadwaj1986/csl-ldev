{@hastināga@}¦, m. (= Pali hatthi°, see PTSD s.v. nāga,
[Page619-a+ 70]
and Andersen's Reader, Glossary, {%an excellent elephant%}),
acc. to pw (citing Divy) {%ein fürstlicher Elephant%}; this fits
some BHS passages well enough, and may be meant
in Pali Vv. comm. 37.8 hatthināga as gloss on nāga of text
(this elephant was indeed a fine one); but it is not always
clear that it means more than (any) {%elephant%} (they are
all noble beasts); one suspects sometimes that hasti- may
be prefixed to distinguish this from nāga, {%serpent%}: Mv
ii.70.7; 74.12 ff.; Divy 74.2 ff.; 286.28 f.; 334.15 (read
with mss.); 370.26. (In late Skt. Hastināgapura occurs
as n. of a city, Schmidt, Nachträge; and acc. to Sheth,
Pkt. Hatthiṇāgapura, or the like, = Hastināpura.)
