{@bhojana@}¦ (cf. the cognate Skt., BHS bhoga, in this
mg.; normally bhojana only {%food%}, in Skt., Pali, Pkt., and
BHS), (carnal) {%enjoyment, sexual intercourse%}; only in
phrase (or cpd.) sabhojana kula, {%a household in which%}
{%sexual intercourse is going on%} or {%about to be practised%}; in
such a house a monk is forbidden to ‘intrude’ (see {@anu-@}
{@praskandati@}) and sit or stand: Prāt 511.8 (a Chin. version
interprets as a house where man and wife engage, sc.
habitually or excessively, in sexual intercourse); Mvy
8465 sabhojanakula-niṣadyā, and 8466 °sthānam (Tib. ñal
po byed pa[r] śom paḥi khyim na, {%in a house where pre-%}
{%parations are being made to perform sexual intercourse%});
so in Pali Vin. iv.95.7, interpreted in this way by both
the old and the later comms.; modern interpreters con-
sistently refuse to admit this mg., but the agreement of
northern and southern tradition forbids anything else,
and the cognate bhoga has the same mg.
