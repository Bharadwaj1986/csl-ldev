{@akṣudrāvakāśa@}¦ (= Pali akkhuddāvakāsa), {%of fine%}
{%(not inferior) appearance%}. Almost always follows prāsādika
and darśanīya; all virtual synonyms, applied to women
and less often to men and children: Mv i.196.20; 352.15;
ii.422.1, 7 (boy); 432.14; iii.35.18 (man); 153.16 (here
prāsādika is lacking); 218.11; 377.12; 404.17 (an infant
boy). In Mv i.197.16 (not accompanied by the other adj.)
said of the family (kulam) in which a Bodhisattva is
born; but perhaps this is an erroneous reading, or if cor-
rect means rather {%possessing no small scope, range, sphere%}
{%of activity or opportunity%} (with the meaning of {@avakāśa@}
normal in Skt., Pali, and BHS). This latter, at least, is
clearly meant by Mv ii.1.7, a parallel passage, which
reads akṣudrāvacaraṃ instead of this. A third parallel,
LV 23.12, reads akṣudrānupaghāti, which surely means
{%not petty and not injurious%} (so Tib., phran tshegs med ciṅ
gnod par byed pa med pa yin), not {%ne frappe pas ceux%}
{%qui ne sont pas méchants%} (Foucaux).
