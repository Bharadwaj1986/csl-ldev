{@sattvāvāsa@}¦, m. (= Pali sattāvāsa), {%abode of beings%}.
Nine such are listed Mvy 2288--97 and in Pali DN iii.263.9 ff.;
in both lists an example only (not an exhaustive enu-
meration) is cited under each ‘abode’. The first includes
all men and lower beings, and the kāmāvacara gods; the
2d, 3d, and 4th are the gods of the 1st, 2d, and 3d dhyāna-
bhūmi (of the rūpāvacara gods); then in Mvy come as
Nos. 5--8 incl. the 4 classes of arūpāvacara gods, and
finally as an example of No. 9 the {@asaṃjñisattva@} (q.v.)
gods; but this arrangement is certainly erroneous; DN
iii.263.19 correctly puts the asaññasatta gods (who belong
to the 4th dhyānabhūmi of rūpāvacara) in the 5th satt(v)ā-
vāsa (the śuddhāvāsakāyika doubtless belong here too),
while the four arūpāvacara classes constitute the 6th to
9th incl. In Mvy the first four are characterized respectively
as nānātvakāyā nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ, nānātvakāyā ekatva-
saṃjñinaḥ, ekatvakāyā nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ, ekatvakāyā
ekatvasaṃjñinaḥ. Cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. iii.22, n. 4.
