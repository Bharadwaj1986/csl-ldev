{@eḍaka-rajas@}¦ (= {@avi-rajas@}, q.v.), lit. {%sheep-speck%}, a
small unit of matter; like avi-rajas Mvy 8195, it occurs
LV 149.6 and Divy 645.11 in tabular lists of very small
weights or measures; in all three, seven {@śaśa-rajāṃsi@}
(q.v.) make one eḍaka-(avi-)r° and seven of these make
one {@go-rajas@} (q.v.). Acc. to St. Julien, cited by Weber
ISt. 8.436 note, the mg. is said by Hiuen Ts'ang and a
Chin. transl. of LV to be {%a grain of dust on the hide of a%}
{%hare (sheep, beeve)%}. But Tib. on both Mvy and LV says
simply {%hare- (sheep-, cow-) speck%} (rdul); to be sure, Das
s.v. rdul declares that glaṅ rdul means {%a mote in the dung%}
{%of an ox, a small particle of cowdung%}. But this, as well as
the different guess from Chin., can hardly be anything
but implausible guesswork. Why should a speck on the
skin, or in the dung, of an animal vary with the size of
the animal? The Tib. itself gives no such indication. It
seems safe to assume that {%hare-speck, sheep-speck%}, and
{%cow-speck%} mean only three different sizes of small par-
ticles.
