{@mahāśrāvaka@}¦ (= Pali mahāsāvaka), {%important%}
{%disciple%} (of Buddha). In general BHS, like Pali, knows
no definite number or list of them (Vism. 98.26 speaks of
the number 80); a typical list of 26 names in SP 1.9 ff.,
but at the end it adds, ‘and others’; no number given in
SP 33.5; 121.1; LV 6.15; Divy 489.11, etc. Only Mmk
makes tentative starts at lists; twice it mentions groups
of eight: Mmk 64.9 ff. Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana,
Mahākāśyapa, Subhūti, Rāhula, Nanda, Bhadrika, Kaphi-
ṇa; but 111.11 ff. varies (1--2 = 2--1 of 64.9 ff.; then
Gavāṃpati, Piṇḍola-Bharadvāja, Pilindavatsa, 6 = 5
above, 7 = 3 above, and 8 Ānanda, who in SP 2.8 is a
mere śaikṣa, excluded from the mahāśrāvaka group);
in Mmk 40.25 Mahākāśyapa and Mahākātyāyana con-
stitute a pair of mahāśr°; in 13.22 ff. is a very long list,
including some familiar and many fanciful and textually
doubtful ones; the same is true of the list of females,
mahāśrāvikā, which follows in 14.19 ff. (beginning with
Yaśodharā); the names in both these lists are omitted
here as being largely unreliable.
