{@pratigha@}¦, generally m., in LV 329.22 nt. (Pali
paṭigha, acc. to PTSD m. and nt.; Skt. pratigha, m.,
{%resistance%}; [Lex. and a few doubtful literary occurrences]
{%anger%}), {%aversion, repugnance, loathing, hostility%} (hardly
{%anger%}, at least I find no clear proof for this mg.; but in
Mvy 1945, where it follows and seems to contrast with
rāgaḥ, Tib. renders khon khro ba, {%anger%}). It is often
bracketed and contrasted with {@anunaya@}, q.v. for citations;
both (= rāga and dveṣa) are evil and must be shunned.
Etymolog. gloss Śikṣ 149.5 {%it is called pratigha because it%}
{%destroys%}, pratihanti, {%roots of merit%}. One of six kleśa, Dharmas
67 (follows rāgaḥ). Other occurrences (without anunaya):
LV 11.5; Dbh 25.4; Bbh 7.16; 161.13; Śikṣ 6.17; 52.9;
251.15; 271.12. See also next.
