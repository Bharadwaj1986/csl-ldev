{@utkarṣayati@}¦ (cf. prec.; not in this sense Skt.; =
Pali ukkaṃsati, °seti), {%exalts%}, i.e. {%praises%}: gdve., Śikṣ
197.10 sacec cañcalendriyo (rājā) bhavati, utkarṣayitavyaṃ
(sc. bhikṣuṇā), {%if%} (the king) {%is flighty%} (unstable), {%praise%}
{%must be bestowed%} (saying: It is very meritorious on your
part that your kingdom contains so many worthy monks
and brahmans who live undisturbed by thieves etc.).
Acc. to Bendall, Tib. has bstan par bya ḥo, and accordingly
Transl. renders ‘the Brother should admonish him’ (more
exactly, the Tib. means {%elucidate, make intelligible%}). But
I do not see how the BHS word can mean this. The mg.
of the Pali word is appropriate here; by encouraging
flattery the king is to be strengthened in a good course.
