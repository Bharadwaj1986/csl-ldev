[{@Maurin@}¦, n. sg. Maurī, printed in text of Laṅk 362.11
pāṇḍavāḥ kauravā rāma paścān maurī bhaviṣyati. Tho
ed. note says that Tib. and Chin. support this reading,
the Skt. mss. read saurī, and this or śauriḥ is surely to
be read (Skt. Śauriḥ = Kṛṣṇaḥ). The reading with m for
s, or ś, is due to anticipation of the name mauryā(ḥ) in
the next line; see the following entry.]
