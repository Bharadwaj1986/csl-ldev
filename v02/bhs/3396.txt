{@uttāraṇa@}¦ (nt.; in this sense not Skt. or Pali; see
{@uttarayati@}), {%carrying out%} (of a promise): Sikṣ 126.7 prati-
jñottāraṇavacanā vā; a neg. is needed; either delete
preceding punctuation and understand a-prati°, in samdhi
with preceding vā; or read with ms. of Bodhicaryav.
pañjikā on 5.54 (ed. 124.3, with note) pratijñānuttāraṇa-
vacanā; in either case, {%not carrying out one's promise%}.
La Vallée Poussin erroneously corrects to the reading of
Bendall's text of Śikṣ.
