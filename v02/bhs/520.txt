<L>520<pc>019,1<k1>अन<k2>अन्-अ-
{@an-a-@}¦, double neg. prefix, = a(n)-, as in Pali (CPD).
In Mv i.14.10 (gambhīro) 'nasamuttaro (see {@samuttara@};
Senart assumes na used in comp.); {@anaparāmṛśant@} (q.v.);
and Mmk 53.21 an-a-patnīkam, {%one who has no wife%} (after
this a word has been lost from the text; it must have
named the place where the appropriate ceremony, to get
a wife, was performed, as in the surrounding parallel
phrases).
