{@? sarabū@}¦ (Pali id., Vin. ii.110.18; Jāt. ii.147.11;
PTSD cites only °bhū), {%lizard%}: perhaps (as suggested in
Senart's note) read sarabūṇāṃ vā (gen. pl.) Mv i.20.6;
23.2, before undurūṇāṃ vā, in a list of animals; mss. very
confused; Senart's text em. kiṃpuruṣ(ak)āṇāṃ, supposed
to mean {%monkey%} (which is unsupported and implausible).
