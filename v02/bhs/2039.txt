{@avakoṭimaka@}¦, adj. (= Pali okoṭ°), {%deformed, mis-%}
{%shapen%}; so Tib. acc. to Speyer, byad (on i.280.3 byed)
ṅan po; the precise mg. in Pali is disputed; Av i.280.3
and ii.152.10, in phrase durvarṇo durdarśano ava°; in Pali
only in corresp. phrase dubbaṇṇa duddas(s)ika oko°. But
mss. of Av avahoṭimako or °ḍimako, and in ii.152.10
Speyer adopts the latter, stating that it is also written
so in the Ratnāvadānamālā version of the same story.
It seems that it should be the same as the Pali word,
which is well attested. Yet I think the form with h is
supported by Laṅk 27.4, mss. uhātrimā, ed. em. uhoḍimā,
and 33.15, text ahoḍimā, most mss. uho°; both initially
in anuṣṭubh lines, where avaho° could be read as a stan-
dard hypermetric type, or u- could stand for ava- (cf.
§ 3.55, {@ukirati@}); Tib. cited as ṅan paḥi mi, {%miserable%}
{%man%}, in Suzuki, Index, which attributes to Wogihara
the interpretation ūnendriya (fitting our word).
