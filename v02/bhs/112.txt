{@agninya@}¦, distorted Sktization of Pali aggañña,
{%primeval%} (derived from Skt. agra, perhaps with -jña?),
see CPD and Senart Mv i note 617: Mv i.340.17 (tam eva)
paurāṇam akṣaram °nyaṃ upanipate, arthaṃ cāsya na
vibhāvayetsuḥ; similarly 341.10; 342.6, 16; iii.206.13;
always epithet of akṣara, and in all but the last associated
with paurāṇa; Pali also combines porāṇa and aggañña
as ep. of akkhara, {%ancient primeval formula%}, in similar
[Page004-b+ 71]
phrase; in BHS always subject of upanipate, {%came in,%}
{%occurred, was mentioned%} (in Pali the phrase is object of
anupatanti or anupadanti, {%they repeat%}; CPD s.v. akkhara 2).
