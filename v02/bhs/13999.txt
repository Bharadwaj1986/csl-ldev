{@vibandha@}¦, m., and {@vipratibandha@}, m. (= Pali
vibandha, Pv. comm. 207.16, {%obstacle%}, not {%fetter%} with
PTSD), {%hindrance, obstacle, obstruction%} (wrongly defined by
Wogihara, Lex. 37; correctly LaV-P. on AbhidhK. vi.300,
vibandha = {%obstacle%}); the two words have been noted
(except as just stated) only in Bbh and are used there
interchangeably: (129.16) bodhisattvaḥ dāna-vibandham
api dāna-vibandha-pratipakṣam api ({%what is an obstacle%}
{%to giving, and what counteracts that obstacle%}) yathābhūtaṃ
prajānāti.(18) tatra catvāro dāna-vibandhāḥ (v.l. °viprati-
bandhāḥ; they are described in detail)…(130.2) dāna-
vipratibandha-pratipakṣaṃ niśṛtya ({%taking recourse to that%}
{%which counteracts the obstacle…%})…dadāti…(130.6)
vighāta-kṛtaṃ dāna-vipratibandha-hetuṃ…(131.6) ca-
turvidhasya dāna-vibandhasya caturvidhaṃ dāna-vipra-
tibandha-pratipakṣa-jñānaṃ veditavyaṃ…(131.23) dāna-
vipratibandha-pratipakṣa-jñānam upādāya; again, one of
the 6 {@upāya@} (q.v.) of a bodhisattva is the vibandha-
sthāyin (upāya), {%that acts as a block%} (misunderstood by
Wogihara l.c.), Bbh 264.8, discussed 267.3 katamo bodhi-
sattvasya vibandha-sthāyī (v.l. °stha) upāyaḥ? iha bodhi-
sattvaḥ…(5) sattvānāṃ vipratibandhenāvatiṣṭhate ({%is%}
{%in the position of a block, hindrance%}, to the natural, worldly
behavior of creatures); the text then explains how the
Bodhisattva bribes creatures to abandon their natural
immorality and live morally by promising them the
worldly enjoyments they crave, on that condition; in this
passage vipratibandha is constantly used, 267.5, 14, 19,
24; 268.3, 6; but at the end, 268.11, vibandha-sthāyī (or
rather in mss. °stha) upāyaḥ is used again, and in 268.9,
just above, evaṃ vibandha-sthitasya bodhisattvasya;
once more, Bbh 388.6 (aprāpteṣu caiṣu, sc. dhyānādiṣu, cf.
lines 3--4) prāptaye vibandha-saṃkleśaḥ, {%the%} (sort of)
{%impurity%} (one of two kinds) {%that, when they have not been%}
{%attained, consists in an obstacle to their attainment%}.
