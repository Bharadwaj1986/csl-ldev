in Pali, see Childers s.v. dhammo) nt.: SP 70.2 (vs) acc.
to Kashgar rec. duḥśrāddheyam idaṃ dharmaṃ deśitam
adya śāstṛṇām (ms.), but Tib. seems to support Nep. mss.
which lack dharma; idam…dharmaṃ śrutvā SP 71.3
(prose; KN em. to imaṃ, which WT keep without note);
aśrutvaiva…idam…dharmaṃ SP 60.4 (here kept with
all mss. in both edd.); mā…a-dharmaṃ utpadyate LV
15.10 (prose), {%may no wickedness arise%}; idaṃ dharmaṃ

(n. sg.; in next sentence dharmo).--({@1@}) {%characteristic,%}
{%quality%}, substantially as in Skt. (BR s.v. 2), but used in
BHS, as in Pali dhamma, very commonly and in a way
which seems specially pointed and deserving of special

mention: asti-dharma, see s.v. 1 {@asti@}; vināśa-dharmeṇa
({%subject to destruction, perishable%}) mānsena Mv i.94.12;
divyāś ca kāyāḥ parihāṇa- (v.l. °ṇi-) dharmāḥ SP 162.3
(vs), {%and divine bodies were characterized by diminution%},
i.e. became few (meaning proved by parallel 170.2; wrongly
Burnouf and Kern); māreṇa…īrṣyādharmaparītena LV
267.2 (prose), {%full of the quality of jealousy%}; catvāra ime…
duḥkhavipākā dharmāḥ RP 19.16 (prose), {%qualities that%}
{%result in misery%}, i.e. vices; in Mv iii.200.5 are mentioned
eight āścaryādbhuta dharma, {%marvelous qualities%}, of the
Buddha, seven of which (the eighth apparently being
omitted by mistake) are listed 200.6--202.2; they cor-
respond imperfectly to the eight yathābhucca vaṇṇa of
Pali DN ii.222.7, listed 222.13--224.14 (DN nos. 2, 4, 5,
6, and 8 = Mv nos. 2, 7, 3, 4, 6); śuddhāvāsā ca devā
aṣṭādaśa āmodanīyāṃ dharmān ({%the eighteen ‘qualities of%}
{%rejoicing’%}, here {%conditions of, elements%} or {%matters for re-%}
{%joicing%}) pratilabhanti Mv ii.259.10 (they are listed in the
sequel); ({@2@}) like Pali dhamma, dharma (or dharmāyatana)
is the object of manas (as rūpa of cakṣus, etc.); sometimes
rendered {%idea%}; it seems likely that, at least in origin, it
meant {%quality, characteristic%} (= 1), as that element in the
outside world which the indriya manas (as distinguished
from the five external organs of perception) concerned
itself with; see AbhidhK. LaV-P. i.45, where it is ex-
plained that ‘tho all the āyatanas are dharmas’ ({%qualities%}),
‘because it includes many and the chief (agra) dharma,
one āyatana is specifically so called;’ in any case this
exclusively Buddhist use occurs: dharmāyatanam Mvy
2039; Dharmas 24; dharmadhātuḥ Mvy 2057 (after mano-
dhātuḥ, as dharmāyatanam 2039 follows mana-āy°);
manendriyaṃ dharmavicāraṇeṣu Suv 56.12; similarly 57.8,
etc.; see also dharmāyatanika, s.v. {@āyatanika; (3)@} in Laṅk
used in a peculiar sense; pañcadharmāḥ Laṅk 229.6;
°rma- id. 2.2; the list of them is given id. 228.5 pañca-
dharmo (v.l. °mā, which seems surely correct), nimittaṃ
nāma vikalpas tathatā samyagjñānaṃ ca, which are then
defined in the sequel, but I confess I find the definitions
hard to understand; Suzuki, Studies 155 ff., discusses the
passage and renders dharma by {%category%}; it seems likely
that it started out as a specialized application of mg. (1),
{%quality%}; ({@4@}) very commonly, as with Pali dhamma, {%state%}
{%of existence, condition of being%}; crystallized in the phrase
or cpd. dṛṣṭa dharma, {%the present state, the present life%},
see {@dṛṣṭa-dharma@}; (nāhaṃ…ye) dharmā anityās te
nityato deśayāmi, nāpi ye dharmā nityā te anityato
deśayāmi Mv i.173.2, {%I do not teach that impermanent states%}
{%are permanent, nor permanent ones impermanent%}; mostly
restricted to states of empiric, hence transitory, worthless,
existence: nairātmyaṃ…dharmāṇāṃ Laṅk 1.4; nairātmy’

LV 176.19 (vs); māyasamāṃs tatha svapnasamāṃś ca
…samudīkṣati dharmāṃ; LV 308.9 (vs), but note in 10
that the word is used in two radically different senses,
īdṛśa dharma-nayaṃ vimṛṣanto ({%considering as such the%}
{%rule, nature, condition, of the states of existence%})…dhyāyati
saṃsthitu dharme, {%he meditated…steadfast in the Doctrine%};
dharma pratītya-samutthita buddhvā LV 308.13 (vs, just
after prec.), {%realizing that the states of being have originated%}
{%by dependent-causation%}; śāntāḥ kila (read with WT °lā
or with Ḱ °laḥ) sarv’ imi dharm’ anāsravā…(4) na
cātra kaścid bhavatīha dharmo SP 117.3--4 (vs; Burnouf
and Kern take dharma in 3 as {%law%}), {%all the conditions of%}
{%being%} (in the saint) {%are calmed, free of the impurities%} (so
that) {%there is not%} (any longer) {%in them under these conditions%}
{%any state of%} (conditioned, empiric) {%existence%}; by extension,
however, even nirvāṇa is called a dharma, {%state of being%}:
(śreṣṭho…) dharmāṇa nirvāṇaṃ iva Mv i.166.18 (vs),
(Buddha is the best of creatures) {%as nirvāṇa of states of%}
{%being%}; nirvṛtau…dharma (loc. sg.) RP 6.9 (vs), {%in the%}
{%state%} (of) {%nirvāṇa%}. See also the following cpds., esp. {@dharma-@}
[Page277-a+ 71]
{@kāya@}. For Dharma as n. pr. see prec.; for dharma as adj.
see next. I have not listed dharma {%law, doctrine%} (second
of the 3 ratna, Dharmas 1 etc.), since it is both extremely
common and hardly un-Skt. It may refer particularly to
the collections of sūtras which set forth the Doctrine;
see e.g. {@dharma-caryā@}.--dharma is also one of the
four {@pratisaṃvid@}, q.v.; on the mg. here see esp. AbhidhK.
LaV-P. vii.89. ff., with references (note Dbh 77.3 ff.); it
seems likely to belong to mg. (4) but definitions are con-
fusingly variant and obscure.
