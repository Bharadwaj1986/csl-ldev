{@pradāsa (°śa)@}¦, m. (= Pali paḷāsa, see Pugg. 19.1--3),
{%envious rivalry%}, the quality of being unwilling to see
another get any advantage over oneself; M. Müller on
Dharmas 69 {%contentiousness%}; always associated with
mrakṣa and īrṣyā (similarly in Pali, where comms. gloss
yugaggāha, see s.v. {@mrakṣa@}): Dharmas 30, line 4, read
°saḥ for pradānaḥ (between īrṣyā and mrakṣa); 69 (text
°śaḥ); °saḥ Mvy 1964 = Tib. ḥtshig pa, {%burning%}, also of
violent pain; acc. to Lévi, Karmav 37.19 and 38 note 1
(and Tib. p.185) Tib. has ḥchig (read ḥtshig?) pa for
pradāśaḥ, as he prints it (but his only ms. paridāghaḥ,
which corresponds to Tib. ḥtshig pa; it follows mrakṣaḥ,
as in some other passages, and is surely to be kept! cf.
Śikṣ 198.8 -mrakṣa-paridāha-, and see {@mrakṣa@}); I do
not find ḥchig pa in a suitable mg. in Tib. Dictt.; Chin.
on Mvy has, as second gloss, {%irritation, anger%} (the first
gloss is obscure).
