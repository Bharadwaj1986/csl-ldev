{@Āyudhiṣṭhira@}¦ (?), n. of a Bodhisattva: Gv 443.4.
<div n="lb">Uncertain reading; initial in saṃdhi with preceding -a,
<div n="lb">permitting analysis as Ayudhi°, which seems scarcely
<div n="lb">possible; perhaps the long ā is an error or misprint, and
<div n="lb">we should understand Yudhiṣṭhira.
