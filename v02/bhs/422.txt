{@adhipati@}¦ (as in Pali) used in figurative sense, {%con-%}
{%troller, dominant influence%} or {%factor%}: {@adhipati-pratyaya@},
{%relation of dominance%} (CPD), Mvy 2270, fourth of 4 kinds
of {@pratyaya@} (1), q.v.; adhipatinā (sc. pratyayena) Śikṣ
253.2; Bbh 14.4, 10 etc.; 80.22; defined as upāya-hetu,
99.2--3; etc. (common in Bbh); the four pratyaya listed
also ŚsP 80.4, but there seems to be a corruption in place
of adhipati: ālambanāmateya-samanantara-hetu-pratyaya-
tām (text °tā; amateya or ām° instead of adhipati!); the
other three are as in Mvy; {@°ti-phalam@}, {%dominant fruition%},
one of the 5 {@phala@} (acc. to Sūtrāl. of karuṇā), Mvy 2273,
‘because it is the seed of supreme enlightenment’, Sūtrāl
xvii.31, comm.; but in more general sense Bbh 102.18,
expl. 103.5 ff., cakṣurvijñānaṃ cakṣurindriyasyādhipati-
phalam,…(etc. with all senses,) svena-svenādhipatyena
yat phalaṃ nirvartate, tad adhipatiphalaṃ.
