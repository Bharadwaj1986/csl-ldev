{@? Bhuḍhuka@}¦, or better {@Bhudhuka@}, ed. at Laṅk
366.14 (vs), but apparently by em.; mss. Pudruka, Bud-
dhaka; Tib. Bhu-dhu-ka (dental dh!); I see no reason to
assume domal ḍh, but the true form is very incertain.
Seems to be the name of an astronomical work: bhu-
dhuka-jyotiṣādyāni bhaviṣyanti kalau (so read) yuge.
