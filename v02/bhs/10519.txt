{@pravijṛmbhitā@}¦, ppp. f. (to Skt. pra-vi-jṛmbh-, once
in pw in somewhat different mg.), {%spreading out (her legs)%},
of a woman in childbirth: (sā, i.e. Māyā, in bearing the
Bodhisattva) °tā salīlaṃ (or °lā) Mv i.149.16 (here Senart
keeps pratijṛ° with mss.) = 217.17 = ii.19.18 (vs; in the
two last Senart pravi°, which is suggested by readings of
mss. ii.19.18 and should certainly be read each time); cf.
LV 83.5 (prose) vijṛmbhamānā sthitābhūt, which means
the same; wrongly Senart's note Mv i.495.
