a virtual synonym of taṇhā; defined by Childers {%desire,%}
{%lust%}), {%leading (that which leads) to (continued) existence%}; ep.
of tṛṣṇā: tṛṣṇāṃ °trīṃ Mv ii.307.12; alone, but clearly
implying tṛṣṇā, in Mv i.247.18 (vs) aśeṣā bhavanetrisaritā

{%stence are dried up%}; dharmā ({%states of being%}) bhavanetrikā(ḥ)
Mv iii.337.13; 339.12. (In Mv ii.206.15 Senart puts this
into text by em., but read with mss. purimabhava-jane-
triye bhavanighātī, which is sound in meter and sense.)
