({@abhinirvṛtta@}¦, ppp. Skt., also Pali °nibbatta; cf.
{@°vartaka, °vartana, an-abhi°@}; {%come into being%}: to be
read with ed. Divy 71.6 (mahānyagrodhavṛkṣo) 'bhi°
(most mss. °vṛtaḥ), and with Senart's note on Mv i.168.7
°vṛttaṃ dharmaṃ deśenti nāyakāḥ. Senart does not
indicate that this is an em., altho both his text and the
crit. app. read °vṛtaṃ; this however seems uninterpretable
in the context. Senart understands {%attained to%} (repeated)
{%existence%} (with different Buddhas). Cf. under {@abhinivar-@}
{@tate@}.)
