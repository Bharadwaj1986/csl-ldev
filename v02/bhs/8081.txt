{@nayuta@}¦, m., nt. (not in Pali, which has nahutaṃ,
nt.; AMg. ṇaua, ṇauya, defined as 84 lacs of niyutāṅgas),
seems to occur in BHS as replacement of Skt. niyuta,
with which it frequently varies in mss.; a moderately
large number, generally 100,000,000,000 (niyuta in BHS
usually the same), and rendered in Tib. (like niyuta)
khrag-khrig, which is given the same value by Jä.: nayu-
tam, nt., Mvy 7956, cited from LV 147.21 where Lefm.
niyuto, m., allegedly with all mss.; but nayutaḥ Mvy
8000, and niyutaṃ, nt., 7702, 7828, 8056 (in the last,
however, the value is only 1,000,000, as shown by the
position in the list and Tib. sa ya). Common everywhere:
ambiguous as to gender, SP 316.6; LV 36.10; 52.17;
Mv iii.443.12; Divy 318.10 (mss.); KP 155.2; Gv 255.20
(etc., but niyuta 267.26, 268.14, etc., prob. equally com-
mon); Mmk 25.16; Dbh 19.27, 29; masc. (besides the
above) LV 12.2, 21; both this and niyuta common in
LV, side by side in 151.2--3 (vss), koṭīśataṃ ca ayutā
nayutās tathaiva, niyutānu kaṅkaragatī tatha bimbarāś
ca; Mv i.119.8 (°tāṃ, acc. pl.); 247.1 (°tā, n. pl.); RP
5.13 (°tān, acc. pl.); nt. forms, °tāni, Mv i.72.12; 171.12;
209.5 = ii.11.12; Sukh 30.15 (but niy° seems commoner
in Sukh); in Suv I have noticed only niy°. Cf. {@mahā-nay°@}.
