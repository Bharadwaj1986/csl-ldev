<L>4875<pc>183,2<k1>कियत्<k2>कियत्-
{@kiyat-@}¦ in comp., in interrogative-exclamatory func-
tion (in Skt. only with pejorative connotation, = {%very%}
{%little%}), with complimentary, or at least (when prefixed to
a word in itself uncomplimentary) augmentative force,
= {%exceedingly, in high degree%}: LV 158.2 (vs) kiyad-vibhū-
ṣito bālaḥ pāpacārī na śobhate, (even) {%highly adorned, a%}
{%foolish evil-doer does not shine%}; foll. by api, Śikṣ 130.1
kiyatpraṇītam api bhojanam, {%even very fine (? however%}
{%fine) food%}; 130.11 kiyal-lūhenāpi bhojanena, {%even with very%}
{%poor food%}; 151.5 kiyad-dhīnānām api sattvānām, {%even of%}
{%extremely low creatures%}. Foucaux takes the LV passage
as having indefinite kiyat-; even when the cpd. beginning
with kiyat- is followed by api, as in the Śikṣ passages, it
can hardly be taken as the indefinitizing api.PTSD
interprets Pali kīvat as indefinite in Sn 959, but this is
an error; it is interrogative (-exclamatory). Cf. next.
