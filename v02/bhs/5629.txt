<L>5629<pc>209,2<k1>गन्धकुटी<k2>गन्ध-कुटी
{@gandha-kuṭī@}¦ (= Pali id.), name given to a special
private cell of the Buddha (and a similar one of earlier
Buddhas, so in Pali, and in Divy 333.4--5); esp. one at
the Jetavana at Śrāvastī: Mvy 9151; Av i.96.4; ii.40.1;
153.11; Divy 46.5 and 13 (in both text with mss. °kūṭī);
333.4 (one ms. °kūṭī) and 6. (Divy., Index, wrongly
°kūṭī). MSV ii.142.10 seems to imply that any monastery
might be provided with one; in iii.133.6 ff. directions for
its location (in general, in the center of a vihāra).
