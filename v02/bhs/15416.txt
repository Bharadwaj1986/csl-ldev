[{@saṃvācya@}¦, corrupt, Divy 70.1; acc. to Index {%having%}
{%lived among%}, but read some synonym of gatvā 73.15;
perh. saṃcarya? The two passages are pratically identical:
(vinipātaṃ na) gamiṣyati, kiṃ tarhi (73.15 tu) devāṃś
ca manuṣyāṃś ca saṃvācya (73.15 gatvā) saṃsṛtya (70.1
mss. saṃvṛtya) paścime bhave (73.15 om. pa° bhave)
paścime nikete…pratyekabuddho bhaviṣyati.Mr. D.R.S.
Bailey informs me that Tib. reads in 70.1 mtshams sbyar
ciṅ ḥkhor nas, normally = pratisaṃdhiṃ gṛhītvā saṃsṛtya
(preceded by loc.), and in 73.15 the same preceded by ñiṅ,
for the two gerunds.]
