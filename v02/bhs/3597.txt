{@udvedha@}¦ (m.? = Pali ubbedha, defined as {%height%};
AMg. uvveha, defined by Ratnach. only as {%depth%}; Pkt.
uvveha, acc. to Sheth {%height%} or {%depth%}, also zamīn-ka
avagāha, {%penetration of the ground[?]%}), {%height%} (so surely
in most cases): Śikṣ 246.5 lokadhātuḥ saṃtiṣṭhate, catura-
śītiryojanasahasrāṇy udvedhena; Mv i.196.17; iii.229.14;
232.10 (yaṣṭi, or yaṣṭī…) dvādaśayojanāni udvedhena;
Mv i.196.2 (iṣikāni, so text…) dvādaśapauruṣā udvedhena;
here preceded by figures relating to {%depth%} (extent of pene-
tration of the ground), see {@naikhanya@}, and {%circumference%}
(? see {@parigohya@}); in a close parallel, Mv iii.228.13,
(iṣīkāni…) dvādaśapuruṣa-udvedhena (mss. udvehena,
uddehena) is preceded by the statement of depth ({@naikha-@}
{@nya@}) and by a form read by Senart tripauruṣoccāni,
which would refer to {%height%} and so be inconsistent with
udvedhena (which, however, if it meant {%depth%}, would
be inconsistent with the preceding form containing naikha-
nya); it seems that Senart should have assumed -parigohya
[Page132-b+ 71]
(as in i.196.2; or some form relating to {%circumference%})
instead of -ucca (mss. read -pauruṣaroccāni or -puruṣaro-
ddhā, perhaps showing, in the syllable -ro-, a faint trace
of that original). Senart himself saw this in his note on
i.196.2, but overlooked it on iii.228.13. Cf. {@āvedha,@}
{@pravedha@}.
