[{@mṛgadāya,] mṛga-dāva@}¦, m. (cpd. only recorded in
BHS and as miga-dāya in Pali, tho both constituents are
Skt.), {%deer-park%}, almost exclusively used of the park
{@Ṛṣipatana, °vadana@}, etc., at Benares, where Buddha is
said to have first preached; the form °dāya is never recorded
in mss., tho Senart adopts it by em. in Mv i.366.8, where
the etym. offered seems naturally to call for it (but cf.
LV 19.4 below): mṛgāṇāṃ dāyo dinno mṛgadāve ṛṣipaṭṭane
(mss.; Senart em. mṛgadāyo ti ṛṣipattano); the foll. all
refer to the Benares park, usually in loc., Ṛṣipatane
(°vadane, etc.) mṛgadāve: SP 69.12; LV 18.20; 19.4
