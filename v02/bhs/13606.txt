{@vikalpa@}¦, m. ({@1@}) (Skt. id., BR s.v. 1 g, at least in very
similar mg., but in BHS more technical; whether Pali
vikappa occurs in this sense is not clear; cf. {@vikalpayati@}
1), {%(vain) imagining%}, esp. {%false discrimination%} between true
and false, real and unreal; seems substantially identical
with {@kalpa@} 3 and {@parikalpa@} 1: compounded or associated
with one or both of them, qq.v., LV 34.11; Śikṣ 272.7;
KP 94.3; LV 250.16; 420.11; 422.20; Gv 350.5--6; eṣo
asaṅgaprājñaḥ kalpair vikalpamukto LV 223.21 (kalpair
here = {%long periods of time%}; in next line kalpair is Lefm.'s
insertion, mss. defective); in Dharmas 135 three vikalpāḥ,
viz. anusmaraṇa-vi°, saṃtiraṇa-vi° (read {@saṃtīraṇa-@},
q.v., with v.l.), sahaja-vi° (cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. i.60);
eight vi° Bbh 50.23, listed 25--27, svabhāva-vi°, viśeṣa-,
piṇḍagrāha-, aham iti vi°, mameti vi°, priya-, apriya-,
tadubhayaviparītaś ca vikalpaḥ (all expl. in the sequel);
Laṅk 227.18--19 also says, vikalpo 'ṣṭadhā bhidyate, but
I find no evidence as to what the eight kinds are (are
they connected with the eight vijñāna, mentioned in
227.10?); vikalpa is a common and important word in
Laṅk, one of the five {@dharma@} (2, q.v. 3); kleśendhana-
vikalpa-kṣayakaraṃ Laṅk 12.3--4, (Buddha) {%who destroys%}
{%(false) discrimination, the fuel of the depravities%} (wrongly
Suzuki); Suzuki's transl. seems also wrong in Laṅk 9.7 ff.
(vss) anyatra hi vikalpo 'yaṃ buddhadharmākṛtisthitiḥ,
ye paśyanti yathādṛṣṭaṃ na te paśyanti nāyakaṃ, apra-
vṛttivikalpaś ca yadā buddhaṃ na paśyati, apravṛttibhave
buddhaḥ saṃbuddho yadi paśyati, {%on the contrary%} ({@anya-@}
{@tra@}) {%this is a false discrimination, viz. abiding in (resting%}
{%upon) the external form of the Buddha and Doctrine. Those%}
{%who see him as seen%} (with worldly sight), {%they do not%} (truly)
{%see the Buddha. And when, having no productive-(false-)-%}
{%discrimination, one does not see the Buddha%} (as an earthly
figure), {%in non-originative condition, he is a Buddha, a%}
{%Perfectly Enlightened One, if he sees%} (thus; the Wei rendering
cited in Suzuki's note seems to me to support this);
({@2@}) (to {@vikalpayati@} 2; the noun not recorded in Pali)
{%gift, provision%} (for a monk or saint or Buddha), esp. of
garments: vayaṃ bhagavato divyāṃ vikalpāṃ duṣyāṇi
(so mss.) dāsyāmaḥ. bhagavāṃ teṣāṃ devatānāṃ vikalpaṃ
(Senart em. °pa; mss. kalpaṃ) duṣyapradānāni nādhivāsa-
yati Mv iii.312.10--11, (let not the Lord accept a garment
of linen rags;) {%we will give the Lord supernatural gifts, fine%}
{%cloth garments. The Lord did not accept the present of those%}
[Page480-b+ 71]
{%gods, the gifts of fine garments%}; vikalpa-hetoḥ Bbh 128.16,
{%as a gift%} (see the preceding passage s.v. {@vikalpayati@} 2).
