<L>16924<pc>598,1<k1>सुजातजात<k2>सुजात-जात
{@sujāta-jāta@}¦, adj., in LV 77.16 (prose) {%agreeable%}, of
sounds: °ta-śabdāś ca śrūyante sma, {%and%} (only) {%agreeable%}
{%sounds were heard%}; so Tib., sgra skad sñan baḥi sgra dag
kyaṅ; contrasting with ill-omened sounds (as of crows,
jackals, etc.) just mentioned as abolished; here there can
be no doubt of the mg. Cf. Pali Sn 548 paripuṇṇakāyo
suruci sujāto cārudassano (of the Buddha). Perhaps in
the same mg. sujātajātaḥ LV 112.12 (prose), in a list of
epithets of Śākyamuni, {%agreeable%} (but Tib. here legs par
skye bas skyes pa, quite literally, {%born by a good birth%}).
Perh. also in LV 96.6; here, after the Bodhisattva's birth,
(apsarases) bodhisattvamātaram upasaṃkramya sujāta-
jāta-tām aklāntakāyatāṃ ca paripṛcchanti sma (Lefm.
sujātajāte tām, but read with v.l. as above, and so in
repetitions 8, 10, 12, 14); this, it seems, in view of the
parallels, may well mean {%approached…and inquired as%}
{%to her agreeable%} (physical) {%condition and state of having%}
{%an unwearied body%}, despite Tib. bltams pa legs par bltam
mam, lit. {%well-born born state%}, which Foucaux, not un-
naturally, takes to refer to successful parturition; yet
the BHS (with -jāta, not jāti) hardly supports this.
