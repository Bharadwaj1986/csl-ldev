{@kevattaka@}¦, adj. (cf. s.v. {@keva@}, and prec.), {%how many?%}:
Mv i.101.2 (prose) kevattakāni (mss. °vartt°) karmāṇi;
Senart also reads forms of this adj. in i.83.12; 97.3; 351.15
(and see s.v. {@kevatika@}), but in all of these the mss. are
very confused and do not really establish the reading.
