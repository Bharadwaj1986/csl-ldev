{@Uttarakuru@}¦, if Senart's text is right, in Mv i.103.10
designates an {%inferior%} region or people in which successful
Bodhisattvas are {%not%} reborn: °ruṣu nopapadyanti (along
with pretas, asuras, and animals). But mss. all vary: utte
ca kuruṣu, uttame ca kuleṣu, (one only) uttara ca kuruṣu.
Doubtful. As n. of one of the dvīpas, see {@dvīpa@}.
