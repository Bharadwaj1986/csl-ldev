(? in Pali, at least later, n. of a locality in the Malla
country or of the śāl-grove there where Buddha entered
nirvāṇa): Divy 208.25, 209.3 (tathāgato…pari)nirvāṇāya

580.9(--10) (vss) Mallānām upavartane (text °te), Yamaka-
śālakavane madhye nirvāṇaṃ me bhaviṣyati; 580.17 (vs)

for text upadartate!); 598.22--24 (vss) Yamakaśālavane
vane caitye makuṭabandhe tu (cf. 580.11 caitye makuṭa-
vardhane) Mallānām upavartane, parinirvṛte (? read °to
or °taś) ca tatrāhaṃ…Occurs in Pali and BHS only
in reference to the place of the Buddha's parinirvāṇa.
In the canonical Pali texts, e.g. DN ii.137.3 (cf. comm.
ii.572--573) yena Kusinārā upavattanaṃ Mallānaṃ sāla-
vanaṃ ten(a)…, and cf. esp. Dpv. 15.70 Kusinārāyaṃ
bhagavā Mallānaṃ upavattane, it could be understood
[Page141-a+ 71]
as {%the country%} (of the Mallas); but the comms. seem to
have taken it as a place-name, specifically the name of the
śāl-grove where the Buddha died. And this is perhaps
confirmed by one passage, Dpv. 6.19 yadā ca parinibbāyi
saṃbuddho Upavattane, where the gen. Mallānaṃ is not
found, and Upa° most naturally would be a n. of a place
(but see below). In Akanuma's Dictionary of the Proper
Names of Indian Buddhism the word is misquoted as
Upavattava = Skt. °vartava (but the Chinese transcrip-
tions quoted end consistently in -tan, supporting °vartana);
the Chin. translations seem regularly to interpret it as a
common noun, {%uncultivated land%} (the word for {%land%} usually
rendering bhūmi, {%land country%}). This may be interpreted
as support for use as a common noun, as it is used (rarely)
in Skt. Note that in BHS the name of the grove is clearly
{@Yamakaśāla(ka)vana@}, q.v.; not so in Pali.Modern editors
and interpreters seem unanimously to take Pali Upavattana
as n. of the grove (see DPPN s.v. for some other references;
but the important Dpv. 6.19 is not cited there). On the
other hand, Divy ed. prints upavartanaṃ with a small
initial letter; it fails to record the word in Index or Notes.
I am inclined, with some dubiety, to understand the
BHS word as a common noun, {%country%}. Even the Pali
word may have had that meaning originally, and in the
canonical passages still. Later, the Pali comms. seem
clearly to have understood it as the n. of the śāl-grove;
and in Dpv. 6.19 it looks like a place name. Yet, if the
Chin. translation {%uncultivated%} (waste, barren) {%land%} be
accepted, perhaps upavattane might be understood in
this sense in that passage.
