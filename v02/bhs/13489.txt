{@vātātapa@}¦, m. pl. (ordinarily {%wind and sunshine%} as in
Skt., e.g. Mv iii.350.10; but also) {%wind and heat%} as bodily
{%humors%} (dhātu): Mv iii.143.16 abhiṣyaṇṇā (q.v.) vātātapā,
resumed 144.6 by abhiṣyaṇṇehi dhātūhi, which, as well
as the general context, appears to prove that ātapa is
here one of the bodily {%humors%} (as well as vāta, which is
normal in this sense), viz. = pitta (q.v., BR).
