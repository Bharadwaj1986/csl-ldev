{@Duṣprasaha@}¦, n. of a Buddha in a remote Buddha-
kṣetra and different universe, but contemporary with
Śākyamuni; he stopped preaching when the latter ‘turned
the wheel of the law’: Mv iii.342.3 ff.; the same personage
may be meant (tho this incident is lacking) by Buddhas
of seemingly exceptional renown so named at Sukh 70.1,
and (spelled Duḥprasaha) Mmk 64.1; 130.3.
