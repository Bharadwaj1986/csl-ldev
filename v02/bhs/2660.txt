[{@ātmabhāvatā@}¦, Senart's em. Mv ii.301.11 (prose)
sarvatra bodhisattvasya °tām anuprāptāṃ saṃjānanti;
should mean {%embodiment%}, from ātmabhāva plus -tā. But
the occasion is the approach to his enlightenment (not
his conception or birth), which is signalized by miracles
and cosmic portents. The mss. read °bhāvanām, which is
doubtless right: {%they recognize on all sides that the Bodhi-%}
{%sattva's self-realization%} (ātma-bhāvanā) {%is at hand%}.]
