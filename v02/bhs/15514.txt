sena (bhavate avidya…) LV 419.17(--18), vs; there is no
noun for the two instr. adj. to agree with, unless we separate
saṃkalpa (as instr., § 8.8), {%by false discrimination produced%}
{%by vain fancy, and superficial, (ignorance comes to be)%}; or
understand manasikāreṇa as suggested by ayonisena? Tib.
kun rtog (= saṃkalpa) rtog pas ({%by kalpa%}) bskyed paḥi
tshul bzhin ma yin pas, which perhaps supports the
second alternative, as it seems to make -janitena modify
ayonisena. (In SP 97.13, vs, read anyonyasaṃkalpa-
sagauravāś, as one word, {%having respect for each other's%}
