{@ūhasati@}¦ (= Pali id.; whether it represents Skt. ud-,
ava-, or upa-has- is a moot question), {%laughs%} (in joy):
[Page151-b+ 11]
Mv i.218.18 = ii.20.20 (vs), all mss. mahāhāsaṃ ca ūhati,
kept by Senart (see his note); I think we must read ūhasi
(or °se), 3 sg. aor.; ii.268.13 ff. mahā-ūhasitaṃ ūhase
(repeated several times), {%laughed a loud laugh%}; i.221.20 =
ii.24.7 (vs) ūhasāsi (seems guaranteed by meter and sense;
mss. in ii.24.7 ūhāsasi, ūhasari; in i.221.20 more remote;
the laugh is one of joy over the following thought:) ayaṃ
dānim eko bhavo paścimo (t)ti.
