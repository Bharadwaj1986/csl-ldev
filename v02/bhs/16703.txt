{@? sāmāyi@}¦ (-kāmaṃ?), obscure: LV 37.5 (vs) anyo-
'nya-gama-(v.l. °gamana, which meter seems to require)-
yuktā yathaiva sāmāyi kāmaṃ (Calc. °yi-kāmaṃ as one
word) ca; Tib. seems to render the whole line: dper na
ḥdus pa dag ni khri las su (Foucaux, {%et, par exemple, les%}
{%réunions sur des tapis%}), phan tshun ḥgro bar sbyor bar
byed daṅ mtshuṅs, app. {%like one performing coition in%}
{%moving back and forth%} (in moving towards one another);
so essentially Foucaux. Pali has adj. sāmāyika, seemingly
based on samaya; is sāmāyi related to this? for samāyi,
n. sg. of °yin, perh. with ā of first syllable m.c.? But the
resulting sense is hardly satisfactory.
