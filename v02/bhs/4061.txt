{@Ekaśṛṅga, °gaka@}¦, n. of the hero of what the colophon
Mv iii.152.19 calls Nalinīye rājakumārīye jātakam; later
iii.272.17 it is referred to as Ekaśṛṅgajātakaṃ (punaḥ
kartavyaṃ); °śṛṅga iii.144.17 ff.; °śṛṅgaka (prose) 144.18;
145.7 ff. He corresponds to Skt. Ṛśyaśṛṅga, Pali Isisiṅga
(in the Naḷinikā-jātaka, 526), and doubtless is meant by
the maharṣi {@Ṛṣiśṛṅga@}, q.v.; both occur Māy 256.31.
