{@srota-āpatti, srotāpatti@}¦, often written śrot°, so
regularly in Mv, Divy, and mss. of Av (= Pali sotāpatti),
{%‘entrance into the stream’, conversion%} to Buddhism, the
state of the {@srota-āpanna@}, the first of the four stages of
Hīnayāna religious development, the others being the states
of the {@sakṛd-āgāmin, anāgāmin@}, and {@arhant@}; esp. often
in comp. with -phala, {%the fruit%} of this attainment; con-
tracted form °tāpatti regular in Mv, prose as well as vss,
in other texts rare in prose (Divy 17.21), used in vss
where favored by meter (so, I believe, regularly in Laṅk,
e.g. srota-āpatti-gati- 116.13, prose, srotāpatti-phalaṃ,
mss. śro°, 65.9, vs); śrota-āpatti-pratipannaḥ Mvy 5131;
śrotāpatti-phala Mv i.175.1 (vs); 312.13 (prose); iii.254.11
(prose); 346.13 (vs); śrota-āpatti-phala Divy 46.26; 50.8,
etc.; Av i.65.1 (ms., Speyer em. sro°) etc., common.
