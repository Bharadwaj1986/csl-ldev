{@-chana@}¦ for -channa (Skt.), {%covered%}, in (text) duccha-
naṃ and succhanaṃ, yathā hy agāraṃ du° Ud xxxi.11--16
and…su° 17--22; meter favors, indeed almost demands,
channaṃ, which is read in the same vss in Pali, Dhp. 13,
14, and must, it seems, be adopted here, tho the manifold
repetition of this obvious error is strange.
