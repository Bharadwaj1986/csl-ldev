{@? apakṣya@}¦, adj. (cf. Skt. pakṣya, {%adherent of a party%},
as deva-p°), {%having no adherents%}: doubtful reading, LV
301.4 (vs), Lefm. apakṣyapakṣyo, but many mss. apakṣa-
pakṣo; we must read certainly pakṣo, and before it as
a separate word apakṣya or apakṣa (n. sg. m.), {%your%} (Māra's)
{%party is without adherents%}. The form apakṣa occurs in Skt.
(Mbh. Crit. ed. 1.134.24) and in LV 273.3 saṃsāra-
pakṣāpakṣa-karaṇa-gatiḥ, {%with the gait of one who makes%}
{%partisanless the party of the saṃsāra%}; LV 302.13 (Māraḥ)
svapakṣaṃ cāpakṣam apaśyat, {%saw his party without%}
{%adherents%} (i.e. {%annihilated%}); also in Pali as apakkha (which
however could of course = apakṣya); whereas apakṣya
has not been noted elsewhere.
