{@Kanakamuni@}¦, (Tib. gser thub, {%gold muni%}), also
{@Kanaka@} (Mmk 130.4, prose, Kanakādyais tathāgatair;
Laṅk 365.5, with {@Krakucchanda@} and {@Kāśyapa@}), Kanakā-
hvaya ({%the one named Kanaka%}, LV 281.14; 283.17, with
the same two others), in Mmk 68.27 text corruptly Kabaka-
grani; in Mv Kanakamuni i.294.20; 318.13 (in the former
with the prefix {@Bhāna-@} or {@Bhāma-@}, q.v., acc. to text),
but otherwise in Mv only {@Konākamuni@} (or {@Koṇ°@}; Senart
usually gives n, but see his Introd. to i p. xiv f.; also
Konāka-nāmo, nom. sg., ii.300.4; 336.8, and Konāka-
sāhvayo ii.401.7); this form occasionally in other texts,
Mmk 426.9 in a confused list also containing the other
form (Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa, Krakutsanda, Śikhin, Viśva-
bhu, Konākamuni!), also Laṅk 29.1 = 142.14; Māy 227.17
(but Kanakamuni Laṅk 141.9; Māy 250.10, and Kanaka
Laṅk 365.5); Konāgamuni Karmav 97.1, 5 (but Kanaka-
muni 71.21; and so v.l. 97.1, 5; same vs in Pali Therīg. 518,
Koṇāgamana) = Pali Koṇāgamana or Konā° (even in
late Pali, Buddhavaṃsa comm. 213.14, acc. to DPPN,
the form Kaṇakāgamana is used in a popular etymology
of the name; doubtless Koṇāka or Koṇāga- was original),
Aśokan Konākamana, n. of a former Buddha, next but
one before Śākyamuni, preceding {@Kāśyapa@} and following
{@Krakucchanda@}, qq.v.; often mentioned with these two,
see list of passages s.v. {@Krakucchanda@}; mentioned alone,
besides some passages cited above, Av ii.34.11.
