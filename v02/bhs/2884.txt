{@Ārati@}¦, f., n. of one of the ‘armies’ (senā) of Māra:
Mv ii.240.3 (vs) kāmā te prathamā senā dvitīyā ārati
vuccati.The meter is indifferent as to a- or ā- initially,
and LV in the same vs has {@Arati@}, q.v. It is hard to be sure
what meaning was attributed to the word. Foucaux
({%mécontentement%}) and Tib. (mi dgaḥ ba) understand LV
as a-(neg.)-rati.
