{@niryāta@}¦, ppp., adj. (for AMg. nijjāya see under
{@nirjāta@}, with which this seems blended or confused in
BHS; Pali once niyyātaṃ, in MN i.360.9 [puttānaṃ
dāyajjaṃ], {%property%} or {%inheritance bestowed upon his sons%};
comm. niyyātitaṃ, cf. {@niryātayati@}; perh. corruption for
that word; or possibly lit. {%went out to?%}); ({@1@}) in sense of
{@nirjāta@} (1) hardly used, but seems clearly to mean {%come%}
{%from, produced from%}: sarvaratana-niryāta-siṃhāsanaṃ
(mss.) Mv ii.312.7, {%throne made of all jewels%}; in mahābhi-
jñāparikarma-niryātā(ḥ) SP 312.2 perhaps to be read
nirjātā (q.v. for the same cpd., occurring twice); this
cpd. is not in Tib. nor acc. to WT in their ms. Ḱ, but
may have been omitted by haplography, since the next
word is mahābhijñākṛtaparikarmāṇaḥ; ({@2@}) = {@nirjāta@} (2),
which is very little used in this sense and should perhaps
be em. to niryāta, {%adept, perfected, perfectly skilled%}, in
(loc. or comp.): Mvy 864 = Tib. ṅes par ḥbyuṅ ba, {%become%}
{%perfect%} or the like; 2544 = Tib. same, or, tshar phyin pa,
{%completely arrived%} or the like; these two regularly used in
Tib. for this word: dharmeṣu niryātāḥ syāma SP 60.12;
na tāvan niryāto (Kashgar rec. pariniṣpanno; Tib. ṅes
par ḥbyuṅ pa) 'nuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau SP 241.1;
kṣānti-niryātaḥ LV 179.14 (here Tib. acc. to Foucaux
ṅes par byuṅ ba); (mayāpy eṣa…) dharmo 'dhigato
yatra tvaṃ niryātaḥ LV 245.9,…{%in which you are adept%};
pūrvaśubhakarma-niryāta LV 46.22, {%adept%} (perfected)
{%thru previous good deeds%}; abhisaṃjāta-kuśalamūla-niryātā
Mv ii.312.6; mahāyāna-niryātaś ca bhavati Bbh 413.16--17;
samantabhadracaryā-niryātānāṃ Sukh 15.14; sa niryātaḥ
sarvaśikṣāsu Gv 489.26. See s.v. {@niryāṇa@}.
