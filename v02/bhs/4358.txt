<L>4358<pc>165,2<k1>कणय<k2>कणय
{@kaṇaya@}¦ or {@kanaya@} (m. or nt.; = Pali id.; on Skt.
see below), some kind of weapon, said to be a kind of
{%spear%} or {%lance%}; occurs only in long cpds. consisting of
lists of weapons of all kinds: -kaṇaya- LV 305.9 (no v.l.);
306.14 (-kan°, v.l. -kanapa-); 317.15 (several good mss.
kanaya-); -kanaya- LV 218.12 (no v.l.). The form kaṇaya
is recorded as v.l. for kaṇapa in some Skt. passages, BR
2.30, and twice without record of v.l. in late Skt., see
Schmidt, Nachtr. The form kaṇapa is not very common
in Skt. itself, see BR l.c. and pw; it is found Mbh.Cr.
ed. 1.218.24 (Calc. 1.8257) and 3.83* (after 3.21.32 ab;
Calc. 3.810 kaṇapa, Bomb. kanapa); no Mbh. ms. is recorded
with ya for pa in either place. Yet it seems probable that
the variation between y and p is purely graphic; Pali
and BHS clearly support y, which even Skt. sometimes
shows as v.l. for p and which may be the original (rela-
tively very few occurrences are noted).
