{@asthīkṛtya@}¦, ger. (= Pali atthikatvā, °tvāna), {%paying%}
{%careful heed to%}: Mvy 1809. The Pali form is taken by comm.
and modern exegetes as for arthīkṛtvā. Our form might
be a false Sktization of this. But Tib. rus śiṅ ltar ḥdzin
pa, {%taking hold in persevering%} (rus śiṅ; but lit. {%bone-like?%}
rus pa, {%bone%}) {%fashion%} (alternatively, ched cher ḥdzin pa,
{%taking hold more and more, with intensity%}). Is the resem-
blance of rus śiṅ to rus (pa) {%bone%} a mere coincidence?
There is, however, a v.l. āsthī°, which suggests derivation
from a form of ā-sthā-; cf. {@āsthiti@}.
