{@utkūla@}¦, adj., {%high, rising%}; only with nikūla, {%low,%}
[Page121-b+ 71]
{%descending%}, and usually in cpd. utkūla-nikūla (cf. Pali
ukkūla-vikūla, interpreted as {%high and low%}, AN comm.
ii.35.21), {%high and low%}, hence {%uneven%}: Mvy 2708 °lam, and
2709 nikūlam (the Tib. definitions, śaṅ ṅam śoṅ 2708,
ḥbar ḥbur ram mtho dman 2709, seem to refer confusedly
to the pair of words together, and mean {%uneven, high-%}
{%and-low%}); LV 77.17 utkūlanikūlāś ca pṛthivīpradeśāḥ
samāḥ samavasthitāḥ, {%and the high-and-low (uneven)%}
{%places became even%}; 272.17 utkūla-nikūla-sama-kara-
caraṇa-gatiḥ (of the Bodhisattva's gait),…{%making even%}
{%places that were uneven%}; MSV i.14.19 (as an ādīnava).
The cpd. utkūla-nikūla occurs VS 30.14, where it is un-
explained in comm. and not definable by context; utkūla
occurs once or twice besides; nikūla is hardly recorded
otherwise, and seems to be unknown in MIndic (Pali has
vikūla instead, above).
