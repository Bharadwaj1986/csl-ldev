({@timitimiṅgila@}¦, m., cf. prec. two, once in Skt., BR;
Pali °gala; {%a kind of sea-monster%}: Mv i.245.2, 15, 17, etc.;
iii.454.3, where if I understand Senart his mss. read
timitimi° and he em. to timiṅg° for metrical reasons, an
insufficient ground in this instance, meter being bad in
any case; Divy 231.16; 239.29; 502.19, here associated
with timiṅgila.)
