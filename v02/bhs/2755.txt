<L>2755<pc>097,1<k1>आन्त<k2>आन्त
{@ānta@}¦, adj. (cited in MW without reference; not in
BR or pw or Schmidt; Skt. back-formation, or error,
based on Pali anta = Skt. antya; cf. {@antaka@}), {%ultimate,%}
{%final, extreme, supreme%}: Kv 89.6 āntas tvaṃ kulaputra
kṛtas te sattvaparīpākaḥ, {%you are a supreme one…%} (it
would seem more natural, if only tvaṃ were omitted, to
make āntas agree with sattvaparīpākaḥ; perhaps the
passage is corrupt).
