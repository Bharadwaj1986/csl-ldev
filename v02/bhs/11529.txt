[{@madhyena@}¦ plus gen., alleged to mean {%to%}, equivalent
of loc. of goal (Hindi meṃ), acc. to Senart Mv iii n. 502,
on iii.287.2 ahaṃ rākṣasīdvīpasya madhyena gacchāmi.
But this means, not {%I am going to the island of ogresses%},
but {%I am going by way of the island…%} (so madhyena in
Skt.), as is proved by 291.4--5; the merchant's goal was
a puṇya samudrapattana, where he collected jewels and
then returned home.]
