{@naikhanya@}¦, in tripauruṣa-naikhanyāni (iṣikāni, or
iṣī°) Mv i.196.2; iii.228.13, (having) {%a part sunk in the%}
{%earth%} (measuring three man-lengths). Mss. naikhadya or
nakhanya; Senart on i.196.2 reads naikhānya, but in his
note adopts °kha° from the parallel; however, naikhānya
may be right, for the word is clearly the same as that
cited by BR from Ṣaḍv. Br. 4.4 yūpasya yan naikhānyam.
