({@mukha@}¦, nt., seems to me to show no uses essentially
different from Skt.; a few which have caused or might
cause questions to arise are here listed: ({@1@}) ifc., (in a given)
{%direction%}, cf. BR s.v. 3: bāhyamukhaṃ kṣiptāni Mv
ii.458.1, {%thrown outside%}; bāhyato-mukhaṃ kṣipati iii.13.4;
see also {@paścānmukha@}; sthānāsanaṃ śayanacaṅkrama-
ṇaṃ na kariṣya (mss. °ṣye, unmetr.) 'haṃ kapilavastu-
mukhaṃ LV 223.5 (vs), {%in%} (lit. {%in the direction of%}) {%K%}.:
({@2@}) {%entrance, ingress%} (BR s.v. 5 and 8) = {%introduction%},
in {@dharmamukha, dharmālokamukha@}, qq.v.; also
samādhi-mukha SP 312.2, where Kern suggests em.
°sukha, but Tib. sgo, {%entrance%}; in Laṅk samādhi-mukha
12.1 and 13.13 is, to be sure, said to be rendered by Tib.
bde ba, {%happiness%}, i.e. sukha, and this cpd. is found in
the text 222.2--3, while in 72.19 Tib. and Chin. are stated
to omit mukha after samādhi; in LV 181.20 trimokṣa-
sukha- is app. a misprint for °mukha (so Foucaux; no
v.l. cited in Lefm. but Calc. mukha); in LV 352.16 (vs)
Lefm. dhyānā-mukhaṃ, but v.l. with Calc. °sukhaṃ, so
Foucaux (the construction is obscure; no verb in text;
perh. the word is governed by the foll. abhimukhaṃ,
{%in the direction of…%}); upadeśa-mukhaṃ Mv i.193.8,
{%introduction to%} (religious) {%instruction%} (said of the long
section on the 10 bhūmi which follows); prajñāpāramitā-
mukha Gv 125.1; 149.3 ff., here a long list of such °mukhāni,
all named, beginning śāntigarbhaṃ nāma °khaṃ; another
list of such names 448.23 ff., forty-two items, as stated
450.19, which adds that they are however innumerable.)
