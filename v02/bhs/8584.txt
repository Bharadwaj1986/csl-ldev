{@? niṣpula@}¦, nt. (Mironov niṣphalam, v.l. niṣpulam,
nippulam; Kyoto ed. has the same vv.ll.), acc. to one Tib.
gloss, sñigs ma med pa, {%without impurity%} (sediment) Mvy
7635; so one Chin. interpretation; precedes apagata-
phalguḥ (see {@phalgu@}), of similar mg.; AMg. pula is cited
Ratnach. v.73 as meaning {%tumour%}, but whether it is con-
nected with our word does not appear; another Tib. gloss
is śin tu (or, te) med pa, which would seem to mean {%com-%}
{%pletely non-existent%} (unless we should em. śin tu or te to
śiṅ tog, {%fruit%}, in which case the cpd. would mean {%without%}
{%fruit%}, niṣphala). Very obscure.
