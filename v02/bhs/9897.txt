{@Prajñāpāramitā@}¦ (see {@pāramitā@} 2), as n. of a work
or class of works, extant in several versions, of which I
have excerpted for this study two, {@Aṣṭasāhasrikāp°@}

other references under the name of Prajñāp° alone: so
Mvy 505 refers to, and 506-623 cites, a list of samādhis
as Prajñāpāramitodbhavita-(the list occurs ŚsP 1412.8 ff.);
