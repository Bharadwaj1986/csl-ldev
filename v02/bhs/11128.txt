{@Bhaddālin@}¦ (presumably = Pali id.), n. of a disciple
of Buddha, who in a previous incarnation was {@Aśoka@}
(5), q.v., uncle of King Mahāpraṇāda. Note that in Pali
(see DPPN) King Mahāpanāda was a previous incarnation
of Bhaddaji.A confusion of tradition, with phonetic
bearings, seems to have occurred: Divy 56.25; 57.4; 60.11.
