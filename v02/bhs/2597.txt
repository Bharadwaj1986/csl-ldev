{@āchoḍita@}¦ (?), ppp. (for āchorita, cf. Skt. āchurita,
KSS, {%scratched, drawn?%}), {%set, inlaid%} (with strings of jewels):
SP 151.9 (prose) suvarṇasūtrāchoḍitaṃ (buddhakṣetraṃ).
So both edd., but with only 1 ms. (KN); the others °āchādi-
taṃ {%covered%}. However, Tib. bris pa (acc. to WT), {%scratched,%}
{%drawn, inscribed%} (if connected with ḥbri ba), would seem
to support this reading.
