{@galita@}¦, of Buddha's voice, perhaps {%fluent%}: Mv i.315.3
[Page211-a+ 71]
°tam (so or °tam mss.; Senart em. gaditaṃ, but his note
retracts the em.) āviṣṭaṃ bhāṣati, metr. dubious; i.171.11
galita-pada-saṃcayavatī, of Buddha's voice. It would
perhaps be rash to read agalita, which is used in Pali
in the sense of {%(not dropping,) fluent, distinct, agreeable%}
(CPD). Relation of the two forms obscure.
