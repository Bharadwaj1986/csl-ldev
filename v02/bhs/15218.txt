{@śauṇḍā-peya@}¦, also {@śuṇḍā°@}, Bhvr., lit. {%having liquor%}
{%as beverage, drinker of liquor%}: (ye, to be supplied some-
where in what precedes) tena samayena Dīpavatīye rāja-
dhānīye manuṣyā abhūṣi śauṇḍāpeyā (Senart em. śuṇḍā°),
te tena tālapattranirghoṣeṇa…paricāretsu (mss.) Mv
i.194.16; cf. Pali DN ii.172.3--5 ye…rājadhāniyā dhuttā
ahesuṃ soṇḍa-pipāsā (comm. ii.617.11 surā soṇḍā, te
yeva…pātukāmatāvasena pipāsā), te tāsaṃ tālapantī-
naṃ…saddena paricāresuṃ. The same cliché occurs,
more corruptly, Mv iii.227.3; 232.1; in both the word
manuṣyā has somehow been transposed to between śauṇḍā
(232.1 śuṇḍā) and peyā, while the verb abhūṣi is omitted;
there can be no doubt, however, that the original text
was substantially as above in all occurrences (except for
the name of the city).
