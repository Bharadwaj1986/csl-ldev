{@śikṣā@}¦ (see also {@śiṣyā@}), ({@1@}) śi° tisraḥ (or, in Mvy 929,
trīṇi śikṣāṇi), {%(the three) instructions%} (Pali sikkhā), viz. by
the Vinaya (-piṭaka) in reference to moral conduct (adhi-
śīlam), by the Sūtra in reference to thought, intellect
(adhicittam), by the Abhidharma in reference to wisdom,
insight (adhiprajñam); correspondingly in Pali: see Sūtrāl.
xi.1; xx.17; Mvy 929; Dharmas 140; śikṣāsu RP 30.11.
The words adhiśīlam etc. were orig. adverbs (adhi governing
the second member, {%in a manner referring to…%}) and are
still so used, e.g. Bbh 373.20--21 adhiśīlaṃ (and adhicit-
taṃ, adhiprajñaṃ) śikṣā; loc. forms are also used in the
same way, as adhicitte ca āyogaḥ Ud xxxii.27(32) = Pali
Dnp. 185 (same text). These forms may be turned into
adjectives: adhiśīlo vihāro Bbh 335.1; sa vihāraḥ adhi-
citta ity ucyate Bbh 338.21 (this usage seems not recorded
in Pali). Often the stems adhiśīla-, adhicitta-, adhiprajña-
are used as prior members of cpds., in which case precise
analysis becomes difficult; so Bbh 185.14; 333.2; 335.3;
338.24; 341.8; etc. But sometimes adhiprajñā-śikṣā is
used as a cpd., Dharmas 140, the prior member being
then evidently taken as stem of a noun. As nouns, adhi-
śīla, adhicitta, and adhiprajñā, like their Pali equivalents,
are used Mvy 930--2; Bbh 317.2 (parallel with adhimuktiḥ),
[Page527-b+ 71]
being then reinterpreted (with adhi = adhika) as {%superior%}
{%morality, intellect, wisdom%}, see CPD s.vv. adhisīla, °citta,
°paññā; ({@2@}) like Pali sikkhā (tho PTSD and Childers do
not clearly recognize the fact), śikṣā also means {%morality%},
perhaps as a reflex of its use in the cpd. {@śikṣā@} (Pali sikkhā)-
{@pada@}, q.v.: Bhīk 10a.1, after repetition of the five śikṣāpada
the novīce says, teṣām…śikṣāyām anuśikṣe, {%I (will)%}
{%imitate them%} (see {@anuśikṣati@}) {%in moral conduct%}.
