{@kisara, (1)@}¦ adj. and subst. (= Pali kasira, Skt.
kṛcchra), {%difficulty%}, only in {@akisara-lābhin@} and {@alpa-@}
{@kisareṇa@}, qq.v. The use of the former, beside {@akṛcchra-l°@},
proves that the two forms were not felt as identical.
In Pali also (Geiger 59.2) kicchena kasirena are used
together, and evidently taken as ‘different words’. Pkt.
only kiccha; our kisara (perhaps influenced by Pali-Pkt.
kisa = kṛśa) has no recorded parallel in MIndic; ({@2@}) m.
or nt., ‘eine Art wohlriechender Stoff’: Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā,
Lüders, Kl. Skt. Texte 2.43.
