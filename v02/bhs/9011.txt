{@pariṇāyaka@}¦, m. (very rare in Skt., BR, only in mg. 1;
commoner in Pali, in both mgs.), ({@1@}) {%leader%}: °ka-saṃpannā
Mv ii.255.17, said of a herd of deer, {%perfect in their leader%}
(who was Surūpa, a former birth of the Bodhisattva);
as ep. of a Buddha, °kaḥ Mvy 21; mārga-°kaḥ 439; andhe
loke anāyake apariṇāyake Buddho…tārayitā etc., in a
cliché, Av i.4.2; 10.2; 210.13, etc.; ep. of Bodhisattvas,
(loka-) °kānāṃ Mv ii.297.17; (sattvānāṃ…) pariṇāyaka-
bhūtaḥ Gv 219.7; ({@2@}) specifically, the 7th of the 7 {@ratna@}
(q.v. 3) of a cakravartin: Mvy 3628 = Tib. blon po,
{%officer, minister of state%}, app. with both civil and military
functions of the highest rank under the king, so also Chin.,
while Jap. seems to make him more specifically military;
same Tib. regularly elsewhere, e.g. on LV 14.5; for his
functions, see LV 18.3, paṇḍito vyakto medhāvī rājñaś…
cintitamātreṇa udyojayitavyaṃ (read surely °vyāṃ, as
Tib. appears to take it, bsko bar bya baḥi dpuṅ rnams)
senām udyojayati sma, {%he activates as quick as thought an%}
[Page324-a+ 71]
{%army that is to be activated for the king%} (here only military
functions); Divy 217.20--21 suggests military functions;
but contrariwise Mv i.109.14--15 mārgagato praṇaṣṭānāṃ
hatahatanayanānāṃ (read °nāna, m.c.) deśayati (so mss.)
mārgaṃ, tena pariṇāyakavaraṃ labhati ratanaṃ (read
°nam, m.c.; one ms. ratnam) uttamanāyakaṃ; for Pali
cf. DN comm. i.250.12 pariṇāyakaratanena vijitaṃ anurak-
khati; DN ii.177.5 paṭibalo rājānaṃ…upayāpetabbaṃ
upayāpetuṃ apayāpetabbaṃ apayāpetuṃ ṭhapetabbaṃ
ṭhapetuṃ, {%he is competent to bring to the king what needs%}
{%to be brought, to remove what needs to be removed, to hold%}
(make stay) {%what should be kept%}; comm. ii.628.3, on this
passage, says that he is the eldest son of the king, rañño
jeṭṭhaputto va; a sort of {%viceroy%} or {%chief assistant%} to the
king seems to be meant; very often in lists of the 7 ratna,
without specific statement of his functions, e.g. LV 14.5;
101.16; 136.18; Mv i.49.4; 193.17; ii.323.5; iii.377.21; Divy
60.18; 140.25; 211.18; 548.27; Kv 17.20; 49.4; Gv 418.12.
