{@dvitīyā@}¦ (Skt. Lex. id.; Pali [purāṇa-]dutiyikā), {%wife%},
in purāṇa-dv°, {%former wife%}: Mvy 9262; read dvitiyā m.c.
in Mv ii.134.7 (vs) dvitiyās (mss. °tīy°; Senart em. duti°)
tathaiva caturo (so mss.) svajanaṃ ca sphītaṃ (vijahitva,
from line 6); perhaps also dvitīya- (short a! mss. °ye in
405.18, later only °ya-) -kulika Mv iii.405.18 ff., 407.14;
acc. to Senart {%wife's kinsman%}; but I am doubtful of this;
we should expect °yā-; the passage is wholly prose; in
406.1 dvitīya- is omitted, kuliko alone being read; perhaps
rather, {%a second%} (= another) {%kinsman%}, or a {%fellow%} (second)
{%kinsman%}.
