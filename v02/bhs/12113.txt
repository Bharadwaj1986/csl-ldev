{@mukha-puṣpaka@}¦, nt., Mvy 6049; LV 201.19 (vs),
and {@mukha-phullaka@}, nt., Mvy 6048; Mv ii.470.9, some
kind of ornament, in lists of ornaments: Tib. on Mvy for
both me tog ({%flower%}) rgyan ({%ornament%}), for °puṣpaka also
spen tog ({%ornament, finery%}) rgyan; Tib. on LV only me tog,
om. mukha. The force of mukha is uncertain: {%face-flower%}
(some ornament for the face or head?), or {%prime, first-class%}
{%flower?%} In Mv they are made by goldsmiths; evidently
therefore of precious metal, which seems suggested by
the context in LV also.
