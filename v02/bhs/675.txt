{@an-āyūha@}¦, adj. (Pali id.; see also {@anāvyūha@}), {%effort-%}
{%less; free from exertion or striving%}; usually cpd. with {@a-@}
{@niryūha@}, {%without abandonment, riddance, giving up%}; the
two terms together seem clearly to be opposites, and to
mean about the same as a-pravṛtti, a-nivṛtti, {%without%}
{%activity or abstention from it%} (so Suzuki, ‘neither taking
birth nor…going out’, on Laṅk 115.11--12; 196.3).
However, Tib. (e.g. on LV 423.4 and on Laṅk) renders
an-āyūha by blaṅ ba med pa, or the like, and aniryūha
by dor ba med pa, which seem most naturally to mean
{%without%} (intellectual) {%acceptance%} or {%rejection%} respectively;
La Vallée Poussin, note on MadhK 517.20, see {@āvyūhati@},
gives his Tib. versions as mi len and mi ḥdor (which are
equivalent to the above), and equates ā(v)yūha and
nir(v)yūha with Skt. samāropa and apavāda. I find no
support in BHS texts for this interpretation; whether the
Tib. terms must necessarily be so understood I do not
venture to say. Without aniryūha the word occurs Gv
17.13 anāyūha-sarvajñatā-bhūmi-gagana-vīryāḥ (of Bo-
dhisattvas); anāyūhān 25.19 (id.), {%effortless, unstriving%} (in
complimentary sense, like {@anābhoga@}; substantially {%un-%}
{%participating, impassive%}); anāyūhaviyūho (read with 2d ed.
°viyūha-, cpd. with next, if not niryūha-)-gatir bodhi-
sattvānāṃ kāyacittāsaṃpravaṇatayā (see {@asaṃpravaṇa@})
525.11, {%the course of B.'s is free from effort and striving,%}
{%because they are not interested in%} (their own) {%bodies or%}
{%minds%}; anāyūhāniryūha- LV 423.4 (-cakram); °ham ani-
ryūham (dharmacakram) LV 436.13; apratiṣṭhānāyūhāni-
ryūha(ḥ) LV 424.7--8 (tathāgataḥ); anāyūhāniryūhāḥ
