{@? asaṃkhyaya@}¦, adj., {%innumerable%}, occurs repeatedly
(instead of regular asaṃkhyeya) in mss. of LV, and is
sometimes adopted by Lefm. in the text: 86.15 (vv.ll.
asaṃkhya, asaṃkhyeya); 112.4 (with most mss., v.l.
°khyeya). Weller 23 would read asaṃkhyeya always,
perhaps rightly; but the frequent occurrence of °khyaya
in the mss. is strange. Like Weller I am unable to under-
stand the long ā in asaṃkhyayā-kalpakoṭi- 86.15; pro-
bably read °ya- as in 112.4. Instr. of a-saṃkhyā unlikely.
