{@nirodha@}¦, m. (= Skt. and Pali id.), {%suppression%}; in
statements of the 3d Noble Truth, see {@ārya-satya; ni°-@}
{@samāpatti@}, see this; mg. obscure in (sukhito pramuditaḥ
pratikrośaṃ) pratilabhati (sc. in the decadence of religion)
purima-nirodha-dṛṣṭaṃ Mv ii.371.(10--)11 (vs); Senart's
note has what seems to me an unacceptable suggestion.
Could it mean {%(revilings) seen in earlier repressions%} (of
religion)? [See s.v. {@Rodha@} for a wrong reading which would
make Nirodha the n. of a former Buddha, LV 171.17.]
