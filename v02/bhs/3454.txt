{@utsada@}¦, m., and adj. (see also {@ucchada, °daka@}; =
Pali ussada, used in all mgs. here recorded), ({@1@}) {%elevation,%}
{%prominence, protuberance, swelling%}, esp. one of 7 such on
the hands, feet, shoulders, and back of the neck of a
mahāpuruṣa, constituting the 16th of the 32 {@lakṣaṇa@},
q.v. (and cf. Pali sattussada): Bbh 375.20 saptotsadakāyaḥ
(Bhvr.), saptāsyotsadāḥ kāye jātāḥ, dvau hastayor dvau
pādayoḥ dvāv aṃsayor eko grīvāyām; cf. the list Gv
400.9--11,…two aṃsakūṭayoḥ, one pṛṣṭhato grīvāyām;
Mv i.226.19 utsadāḥ, subst.; in Bhvr. cpd. saptotsadaḥ
Gv 400.8; Mvy 250; LV 105.18; 430.18; °daṃ; acc., Gv
128.1; saptotsadāṅga RP 47.9; and in other lists of
{@lakṣaṇa@}, q.v.; ({@2@}) {%addition, supplement%}, in connection or
composition with naraka, {%hell%}, one of the 16 {%supplementary%}
{%hells%} which belong to each major hell (mahānaraka; =
Pali ussada-niraya, not well defined PTSD): Mv i.5.1
aṣṭasu mahānarakeṣu pratyeka-ṣoḍaśotsadeṣu; 1.7.3 kuṇa-
pāto muktā (n. pl.) narakotsadā (abl. sg.); i.8.12 aṣṭasu
mahānarakeṣu ṣoḍaśotsadeṣu, and i.244.19 same; i.9.11
pratyekaṣoḍaśotsadā; iii.454.10 (aṣṭa mahānarakā…)
pratyekaṃ ṣoḍaśotsadā; ({@3@}) adj., {%abundant%}, and n. {%abun-%}
{%dance%} (distinction between the two often not clear; gener-
ally used in prior or posterior part of cpds. where either
could be assumed); certainly adj. in Bbh 379.19 prabhūte-
notsadena viśadenānnapānena (3 synonymous adj., see
{@viśada@}); Divy 646.16 utsadānnapāno bhavati, {%has abundant%}
{%food and drink%}; MSV i.36.18 nāty-utsadamāṃsā tanugātrī,
{%of not excessive flesh, slender-bodied%}; KP 111.2 (prose)
utsada-pātracīvaradhāraṇatayā (an [ākāśa-] {@-paligodha@},
q.v., for an ascetic); 111.5 (vs) tatotsadaṃ cīvarapātra-
dhāraṇaṃ (Tib. lhag par, {%surpassing%}, modifying dhāraṇaṃ);
Śikṣ 56.6 yadi…lābha utsado bhavet, {%if the profit should%}
{%be abundant%} (but Bendall and Rouse, {%should amount to a%}
{%surplus%}); doubtless subst. in Gv 495.16 (bodhicittaṃ…)
utsadabhūtam akṣayajñānatayā, {%it is an abundant store…%};
but 2d ed. utsa-bhūtam, {%spring, source%}; in most of the
rest adj. seems simpler, but subst. possible: Mv ii.319.21
(vs) utsada-prāptaṃ (here perhaps better subst., {%attained%}
{%to abundance%}, sc. of creatures, viz. of the followers of Māra,
as following mārāṇa koṭī…shows; not reduction of
utsadakuśalaprāptaṃ with Senart i.372 note); utsada-
kuśala-saṃcayo Mv i.249.18; 251.12; ii.177.14; abstract
in -tva, Śikṣ 248.5 (yasya, sc. tejodhātoḥ) cotsadatvāj
jvarito jvarita iti saṃkhyāṃ gacchati, {%and thru the abun-%}
{%dance of which a feverish man comes to be called feverish%};
Śikṣ 107.1 (vs) pradoṣa vardhenti vitarka utsadā (adj.
with vitarka, or subst. in comp. with it? Bendall and
Rouse the latter, but text prints as two words!); Bbh
252.16 kaṣāyotsada-kāla-tāṃ, {%condition of time abundant%}
{%in kaṣāya%}; 16--17 niṣkaṣāyānutsadakaṣāya-kāla-tām (…

utsadalolā (so Senart em., mss. all corrupt; but read
°lobhā, proved by Vism.) utsadadoṣā utsadamohā, cf.
Pali Vism. i.103.19 (sattā…) lobhussadā dosussadā
mohussadā, {%having abundant%} (Pali, {%abundant in%}, or {%having%}
{%abundance of%}) {%lobha, doṣa, moha%}; SP 170.1 (vs) apāya-
bhūmīs (so all Nep. mss.) tada utsadāsi, {%the stages of%}

maṇimuktivaiḍūryaśaṅkhaśilāpravāḍarajatajātarūpyaṃ

uddhata unnatāś ca, agauravā mānina lābha-utsadā
[Page127-a+ 71]
(cpd.)…sudūra te tādṛśa agrabodhaye (either {%abounding%}
{%in profit%} or {%having abundance of profit%}). Peculiar is saptot-
sada in Divy 620.13 (Utkaṭaṃ nāma droṇamukhaṃ pari-
bhuṅkte sma) saptotsadaṃ satṛṇakāṣṭhodakaṃ dhānya-
sahagataṃ…brahmadeyaṃ, and 620.28--621.1, similarly,
with sa-saptotsadam; a close parallel in Pali, DN i.87.(6--)7
Ukkaṭṭhaṃ ajjhāvasati sattussadaṃ (comm. i.245.20 sattehi
ussadaṃ, ussannaṃ bahujanaṃ ākiṇṇamanussaṃ…
anekasattasamākiṇṇaṃ ca) satiṇakaṭṭhodakaṃ sadhañ-
ñaṃ…brahmadeyyaṃ; cf. also Pv comm. 221.11 sattus-
sadan ti pāpakārīhi sattehi ussannaṃ (this, in line 16,
= uparūpari nicitaṃ). It seems clear that {%this%} sattussada
in Pali = Skt. *sattvotsada, {%abounding in living creatures%}.
It seems to have been falsely Sktized in Divy (which,
or its source, obviously followed closely a MIndic original
very close to the Pali of DN) to saptotsada, because the
adapter knew familiarly this cpd. as one of the 32 lakṣaṇa
(above, 1). Presumably he thought it meant here {%containing%}
{%seven elevations%} of some sort, but I see no use in speculating
further as to his intentions.
