{@indra-paṭa@}¦, nt., acc. to pw 2.294, {%Luftgewand%}, so
v.a. {%Nacktheit%}: °ṭaṃ śvetapaṭaṃ dhyuṣitapaṭaṃ Kv 81.6--7;
but can indra- have this mg. (= {%sky, air%}, as in digambara)?
I find no basis for the theory. All the context shows is
that persons dressed in these garbs should not be con-
secrated (dīkṣ). What the {%garb of Indra (? of a prince)%}
means is not clear. It is true that śveta-paṭa is recorded
as used of the Jain sect otherwise called śvetāmbara;
doubtless this was the reason for Boehtlingk's conjecture,
based on the assumption that this word equals digambara;
but I doubt that this is sufficient to support it. That
a real sort of cloth is meant is suggested by nānā-paṭeṣu,
line 6.
