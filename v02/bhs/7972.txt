{@dhyāna@}¦, nt. (Skt. id.; in technical sense = Pali
jhāna), lit. {%meditation%} or {%contemplation; mystic ‘trance’%};
Lévi (Sūtrāl.) {%extase%}. Normally {%four%}, as in Pali, described
in some detail in a long ancient passage (the Pali form,
virtually identical, cited in Childers), found with hardly
a true variant LV 129.1--11; 343.14--344.4; Mv i.228.3--10;
ii.131.16--132.5; Mvy 1478--1481; an abbreviated form,
giving the central points, as follows: savitarkaṃ savicāraṃ
vivekajaṃ prītisukham iti prathamadhyānaṃ, adhyātma-
[Page287-b+ 71]
pramodanāt prītisukham iti dvitīyaṃ, upekṣāsmṛtisaṃ-
prajanyaṃ sukham iti tṛtīyaṃ, upekṣāsmṛtipariśuddhir
aduḥkhāsukhā vedaneti caturthaṃ dhyānam iti Dharmas
72; they are the first four of the nine {@anupūrvavihāra-@}
{@(-samāpatti)@}, qq.v.; these are related to the four dhyāna-
bhūmi constituted or occupied by the various classes of
{@rūpāvacara@} gods (see {@deva@}), as explained by Childers,
in that attainment in worldly life of (various stages of
adeptness in) each of the four dhyāna leads to rebirth in
successively higher stages among these gods; catu-dhyāna-
(meter proves single initial consonant pronounced for
written dhy-)-dhyāyino (as before) SP 131.5 (vs); {%three%}
dhyāna, listed as sadoṣāpakarṣa-, sukhavaihārika-, and
aśeṣavaibhūṣita- (read {@°vaibhūtika-?@} see this word),
Dharmas 109; I have found no other trace of this list;
the names sound vaguely as if the first might apply to
the first of the 4 dhyāna, the second to the 2d and 3d
combined, and the third to the 4th; in Laṅk 10.11 na
ṣaḍdhyānādidhyāyinā (tvayā bhavitavyam), {%you should not%}
{%meditate on such things as the six dhyāna%}; apparently some
reprehended practices are meant, but I have no more
idea of the specific meaning than had Suzuki (Studies, 414).
