{@? khāduka-tā@}¦ (cf. Skt. Lex. khāduka, {%bissig, boshaft%}),
seemingly {%snappiness, inclination to bite, bad temper%} (of a
[Page205-a+ 71]
horse): Gv 464.1--2 ājāneyāśvasamacittena sarva-khādu-
katā-(1st ed. °khad°; corr. 2d ed.)-vivarjanatayā; 494.17
ājāneyāśvabhūtaṃ sarva-khādukatā-vigatatayā. But de-
spite the single Skt. Lex. citation, khād- means {%eat%}, not
{%bite%}; it is not a synonym of daś-. Our word contrasts with
{@ājāneya@}, like {@khaṭu(ṅ)ka, khaḍuṅka@}, and I believe it
is only a rationalizing replacement of some form of that
word, q.v. The reading khadukatā, once in 1st ed., may
preserve the original short a of the first syllable.
