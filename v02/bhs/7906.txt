{@Dhānyadrāhyāyaṇa@}¦ (so read for ed. °drāyāyaṇa;
see the readings of the corrupt mss., some of which sup-
port this, the obviously correct reading), pl., n. of a brah-
manical gotra: Divy 635.19. This passage is omitted in
two Chin. translations, my colleague Prof. Rahder informs
me. Cf. {@Dhyāna-drāhyāyaṇī@}, where Chin. seems more
favorable to initial Dhā- rather than Dhyā-. It seems that
one or the other of these two must be an error, and per-
haps Dhānya- should be read in both.
