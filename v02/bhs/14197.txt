{@vivācayati, (?) vipācayati@}¦ (= Pali vipāceti), {%grum-%}
{%bles, makes disapproving remarks%}: °yanti Mvy 2643 (= Tib.
kha zer ba, acc. to Das = mukhara, {%loquacious%}, but Lex.
also {%abusive%}); Divy 492.17; MSV i.44.16; 236.13; °yati
Mvy 9360, but here Mironov {@vipācayati@} (= Pali), and
Tib. rnam par smod pa, {%speaks abusively%}; always the third
of a series of near-synonyms, avadhyāyati (Skt.) and
kṣipati (Skt.; in Divy {@dhriyati@}, in Mv perhaps {@kṣīyati@},
q.v., in a similar context) being the others; in Pali, ujjhāy-
ati khīyati vipāceti. Orig. form not clear; if it was vipāc°,
what etym.? Yet vivāc° looks like a lect. fac., and is not
really a natural form (caus. to vi-vac-?); the occurrence
of vipāc- in Mironov also makes one doubtful. Perhaps
vipācayati was a bit of ancient slang: {%gets%} (one) {%cooked%}
{%= reviles%}.
