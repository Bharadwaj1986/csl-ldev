{@brāhmaṇya@}¦, adj. (in Skt. only brah°, and in Pali
only brahmañña; regularly follows śrāmaṇya, the long ā
of which seems to have influenced this word in BHS),
{%devoted to brahmans%}; regularly after mātṛjña, pitṛjña,
śrāmaṇya; see s.v. {@mātṛjña@} for references. In some
passages of Mv the mss. read brahmaṇya. Cf. {@a-brā°@}.
