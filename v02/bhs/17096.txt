<L>17096<pc>602,1<k1>सुयाम<k2>सुयाम
{@Suyāma@}¦ (= Pali id.), n. of the head of the {@yāma@}
(q.v.) gods: Suyāmadevaputrapramukhāḥ yāmā (so read
with v.l. and Calc., supported by Tib., for Lefm. suyāmā)
devāḥ LV 364.15; yāmādhipatiṃ…ca suyāmaṃ Mv
i.265.6 (so read for Senart Va-suyāmā, v.l. ca Suyāmā);
note also LV 58.21; 302.6, in both of which the official
position of S. is clear from the context; apparently the
same, in general clearly a single individual, lord of his
class, LV 44.10; 58.21; 241.1; 441.17; (formally not clear
whether sg. or pl., but surely sg., LV 50.5; 327.18; 328.3;)
Mv i.208.13; 230.13; 263.19; ii.11.1; iii.315.6; Mvy 3138;
Mmk 69.5 (misprinted Sayāma); Bbh 340.14; cases where
Su° seems to be pluralized, as if used for the class of
yāma gods as a whole, are prob. only apparent; so daśa
ca Suyāma-devarāja-sahasrāṇi Gv 118.22, compare the
parallel daśa ca śakra-devendra-śatasahasrāṇi 119.1
(Śakra was certainly a single individual; similar phrases
with Vaśavarti 117.21; Sunirmita 118.3; and Saṃtuṣita
118.15); cf. Gv 185.7; similarly in Gv 249.21 Suyāma-
devarāja- is followed in 22 by parallel Śakra-devarāja-
(and preceded by Vaśavarti- 17, Sunirmita- 18, and Saṃ-
tuṣita- 20, all names of the individual rulers of their
classes); and likewise Gv 331.8. Accordingly we should
interpret Suyāma patiḥ RP 52.18 and Suyāmādhipatir
Dbh.g. 53(79).14 as {%Suyāma the Lord%} (of yāma gods). In
the Dbh.g. passage we find, to be sure, as a parallel, trayas-
triṃśādhipo bhavet 53(79).8, which can only mean {%lord%}
{%of the Trayastriṃśa (class)%}; but note Saṃtuṣitādhipo 22,
Sunirmitādhipo 54(80).1, and Vaśavartīśvaro ({%the Lord%}
{%Vaśavartin%}) bhavet 9 (in all these adhipo, īśvaro may be
separate words, not necessarily parts of cpds.!) and esp.
Brahmā sāhasrikādhipaḥ 17. So in the RP context we
find (52.17, vs) Brahmāpi Śakra api lokapatiḥ bhavate ca
Saṃtusita devapatiḥ (may be read as separate words!),
(18) Paranirmito 'pi ca Suyāma patiḥ (this may also be
two words!)…
