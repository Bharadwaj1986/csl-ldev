{@aprati-varṇanīya@}¦, in LV 411.10, {%incomparably%}
{%worthy of praise%}, in a list of complimentary epithets of
sounds (śabda), after nirvarṇanīya, {%praiseworthy%}. I believe
that aprati- must be recognized as used in Skt. as prior
element in cpds. in this sense, as e.g. in aprati-cakra
(pw) and aprati-karman (commonly analyzed as a-prati-
karman; but there is no record of any *pratikarman in
the sense of {%a corresponding action%}, and the immediate
constituents seem to me clearly aprati and karman).
Tib. zla med pa, {%matchless%}, for aprati.
