{@utpāda@}¦, m. (Skt. id., {%production%} etc.; so in {@cittotpāda@},
q.v.), ({@1@}) in bodhisattvotpāda, Kashgar rec. for bodhi-
sattvāvavāda, SP 65.1 et alibi, see {@avavāda@} (of which
this seems to be a secondary distortion); ({@2@}) (= Pali
uppāda, for Skt. utpāta), {%portent, omen%}: Mv iii.386.10
°deṣu vidyāyukto (of a brahman purohita); prob. in this
mg. utpāda-gaṇḍa-piṭakāni MSV ii.82.17, (bad) {%omens.%}
[Page126-a+ 71]
{%boils and abscesses%}, or {%boils and abscesses due to the%} (above-
described) {%omens%}; but Tib., if I understand it, fails to
interpret the word. Senart, Mv ii.549, note on ii.279.20,
assumes this mg. also in pūrvotpāda-saṃpanno bodhisattvo,
which however seems to me to mean simply {%perfect in%}
(or, {%as a result of%}) {%previous births%}; so agrotpāda-saṃpanno
ii.279.21; and cf. ii.259.12 ff., also of bodhisattvas, pūrvot-
pāda-saṃpanno…kalyāṇotpāda° agrotpāda° jyeṣṭhot-
pāda° śreṣṭhotpāda° praṇidhi-pūrvotpāda°; a very similar
list ii.291.12 ff. If I am right, utpāda here has its normal
Skt. mg; ({@3@}) {%calamity%} (due to bad omens; development
of 2): °dam āpadyeyur MPS 31.63 (otherwise Waldschmidt).
