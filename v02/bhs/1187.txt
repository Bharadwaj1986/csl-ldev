{@andhakārāpita-tva@}¦, nt. (abstr. from caus. pple. to
denom. verb from andhakāra, {%darkness%}), {%state of being%}
{%darkened%}; so (or, possibly, andhakārāyita-tva, from non-
caus. denom. pple.) I would read at Mv i.41.5; 229.20;
240.9; ii.162.9; iii.334.7; 341.12. The mss. are corrupt in
the entire passage (see {@lokāntarikā@}) and particularly at
this point; Senart reads °kārārpitā, but there is no support
for the -r- in the mss. The Mv seems to have read an-
dhakārā andhakārāpitatvā (? °yitatvā), tamisrā {@tamisrā-@}
{@yitatvā@} (q.v.), {%darknesses, darkenednesses, glooms, begloomed-%}
{%nesses%}. Only Mv has the second member of each pair (the
derivatives of denom. pples.); the other parallel passages
point to something like andhakārā {@andhakāratamisrāḥ@},
q.v.
