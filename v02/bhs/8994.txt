{@parijaya@}¦, m. (see next; = Skt. paricaya, § 2.28, cf.
s.vv. {@paricita, paricetar@}), {%intensive cultivation, thorough%}
{%acquaintance, familiarity, careful consideration%} (with loc.):
Mvy 6532; Bbh 11.16 a-parijayād; AsP 293.1 prajñāyāṃ
parijayaṃ karoṣi; 322.3; 332.9 dhyāna-parijayaṃ ca
karoti; 356.14 ānimitte ca parijayaṃ karoti; 370.3 śūnya-
tāyāṃ; 370.16, 17. Prakritic j for c: Leumann cited by
Wogihara in Bbh. Lex. 32. According to Wogihara, in
AsP 332.9 the word would mean {%conquest, mastery%}, from
root ji, and also in a ms. citation from Yaśomitra, AbhidhK.
(cf. LaV-P. vi.150) yogācāras trividhaḥ, ādikarmikaḥ,
kṛtaparijayaḥ ({%un maître%}, LaV-P.), atikrāntamanasikāraś
ca. I see no reason to separate these passages from the
others. It is clear to me that BHS has only one word
parijaya, and I think Leumann's interpretation is the
true one. Tib. on Mvy yoṅs su (= pari) byaṅ bar (some-
times {%purification%}, but also acc. to Das {%skilled%}; also used
for {@paricita, °cetar@}, qq.v.; note that Mironov reads
parijita, °jetar for these) byas pa ({%made, the making%}), or
ḥdris par ({%acquaintance%}) bya ba ({%making, being made%}).
Chin. and Jap. seem to follow Tib.
