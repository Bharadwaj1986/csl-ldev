{%perfect in the%} (five) {%supports%} or {%aids%}, for getting rid of evil
and cultivating good; so in Pali nissayasaṃpanna AN
iv.353.18; they are there listed in 21 ff. as saddhā, hiri,
ottappa, viriya, paññā; by relying on (nissāya) them one
akusalaṃ pajahati kusalaṃ bhāveti; in Mvy 820 Bodhi-
sattvas are described as sarvapraṇidhāna-niśraya-vigata,
{%for whom all basis for%} (further) {%praṇidhānas is removed%}
(because they are already {%perfect in praṇidhānas%}, as stated
in Mv ii.280.1 and substantially in 259.14, along with
niśrayasaṃpanna); app. {%support%} (of life; Tib. rten) Mvy

{%‘requisites’%} or {%supports, supplies%}, which a Buddhist monk
needs and is allowed, listed 8670--3 as vṛkṣamūlam (for
sleeping), {@piṇḍapātaḥ@} (for food), {@pāṃsukūlaṃ@} (for gar-
ments), {@pūtimukta-@} (q.v.) -bhaiṣajyam (for medicine);
the same four in Pali (nissaya); in this sense niśraya-
dāyaka, m., {%a giver of…%}, Mvy 8731; in Bbh 193.2 also
four, the list in 3--5 is (1) cīvara-, (2) piṇḍapāta-, (3) śayanā-
sanaṃ, and (4) glānapratyayabhaiṣajyapariṣkārāś ca; for
nuns there are only three of these niśraya, since living in
the woods, ‘at the foot of a tree’, is forbidden to them
(Vin. ii.278.14); hence trayo niśrayā(ḥ) Bhīk 22a.5--22b.1;

Mvy 5623 (Tib. gnas or rten) the context suggests {%residence,%}

tatra na śikṣā na niśrayo nāniśrayaḥ, the exact mg. is
not too clear, and Tib. as printed in ed. omits this phrase;
perhaps as in niśraya-saṃpanna, above, {%there is no in-%}
