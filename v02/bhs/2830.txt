[{@? āmukta@}¦, ppp., f. {@°tā@}, acc. to Divy Index {%jewel%}, in
Divy 2.28 (ratnapratyuptikayā) karṇikayā āmuktayālaṃ-
kṛtaḥ; 3.7 koṭimūlyayā ratnapratyuptikayā āmuktayā
jātaḥ; and see {@āmuktaka, °ikā@}. I doubt this mg.; in 2.28
it seems a normal ppp. = Skt. āmukta, °ā: {%adorned with%}
{%a jewel-set earring fastened on him%} (cf. also Divy 614.17
āmuktamālyābharaṇā, {%with garlands and ornaments fastened%}
{%on%}); this is a regular mg. of āmuñcati.In 3.7, to be sure,
no noun is expressed; the same karṇikā of 2.28 is however
clearly meant; possibly here ratna-pratyuptikayā may be
understood as a subst., with specifying ka (§ 22.39): {%with%}
{%a jewel-studded thing fastened on%}.]
