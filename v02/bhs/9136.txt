{@parivarta@}¦, m. (in mg. 2 rarely nt.; in mg. 1 = Pali
parivaṭṭa), ({@1@}) {%turn, revolution%} (so in Skt.): ekasmi citta-
parivarti LV 151.15 (vs), {%in a single turn of thought (= in%}
{%one instant%}); substantially = {%method, process%}, ime punaḥ
pañca dharmāḥ (= bodhisattvaliṅgāni, line 4, cf. 306.1
pañca bodhisattvaliṅgāni pañcaparivartena veditavyāni)
pañcaparivartena veditavyāḥ Bbh 301.8; esp. applied to
one of the three {%‘turns’%} of the ‘wheel of the law’ or stages
in development of knowledge of the four noble truths; they
are most clearly stated in Mvy beginning 1310 āryasatyā-
nāṃ prathamaparivarto darśanamārgaḥ, {%the first turn…%}
{%is the way of seeing%}, sc. what the 4 truths are; these are
stated 1311--14; 1315…dvitīyaparivarto bhāvanāmār-
gaḥ,…{%the way of putting them into effect%}, viz. as stated in
1316--19, duḥkham āryasatyaṃ parijñeyam, duḥkhasa-
mudayaḥ prahātavyaḥ, duḥkhanirodhaḥ sākṣātkartavyaḥ,
duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad bhāvayitavyā; 1320 ārya-
satyānāṃ tṛtīyaḥ parivarto 'śaikṣamārgaḥ (so Tib. mi
slob paḥi lam), the stage in which the efforts of the 2d
stage have succeeded, 1321--4 duḥkhaṃ parijñātam,
samudayaḥ prahīnaḥ, nirodhaḥ sākṣātkṛtaḥ, duḥkhaniro-
dhagāminī pratipad bhāvitā. Similarly LV 417.15 ff.
Similar (but somewhat less clear) detailed statements in
Mv iii.332.13 ff., 333.3 ff. (here the last two parts of the
2d parivarta and the first two of the 3d are omitted, by
accident or compression), and in Pali Vin. i.11.1--18 (here
all is stated, but the three parivarta as relating to each
of the four noble truths are each compressed into a single
statement). The whole is referred to in LV 418.14 as tri-
parivartaṃ dvādaśākāraṃ (because each parivarta refers
to each of the four truths) jñānadarśanam, and similarly
Mv iii.333.11 (omitting jñānadarśanaṃ; trip° and dvād°
seemingly adverbs, the noun is āryasatyāni); Pali Vin.
i.11.25 tiparivaṭṭaṃ dvādasākāraṃ…ñāṇadassanaṃ.
With reference to this, the dharmacakra is called tripari-
varta (usually also dvādaśākāra) SP 179.1; LV 422.2 (vs);
Divy 205.21; 393.23; ({@2@}) m. or (rarely) nt., (orig. {%turn%},)
{%section, part, chapter%} of a literary work; °taṃ (acc.) Samādh
8.20; asmin…dharmālokamukhaparivarte LV 36.6, here
{%section%}, not one of the formal chapters of the work, and so
150.19; parivartān Gv 66.12 ff., {%chapters%}; °taḥ Mvy 1467
= Tib. le ḥu, {%section, chapter%}; regularly in the colophons
[Page329-b+ 71]
of various works, m. in SP, LV, Suv, Samādh, Dbh 99.33
parīndanā-parivarto (read as one word), cf. 98.12 ff.
dharmamukhaparivarto, in body of text; nt. °taṃ Mv
i.27.1 (colophon); I have failed to note the word elsewhere
in colophons of Mv; idaṃ saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra-
parivartaṃ (so with WT) śroṣyati SP 260.7 (prose; acc.);
({@3@}) m. or nt., math., {%square%} (of a number): (after asaṃ-
khyeyam Mvy 7802) asaṃkhyeya-parivartaḥ Mvy 7803
(Tib. bsgres pa, {%multiply%}, Jä.); and so in 7805 etc., and in
the similar table of large numbers 7933 ff. (cited from Gv);
Gv 106.20 ff.; 134.8 ff. (which last makes the mg. unmistak-
able; e.g. aparimāṇam aparimāṇānām aparimāṇaparivar-
tam).
