<L>5536<pc>206,2<k1>खेलु<k2>खेलु
{@khelu@}¦, m. or f., a high number: Gv 133.21; cited
Mvy 7891 as {@śvelu@} (n. °uḥ), q.v.; note that the variant
{@svela@}, m., occurs with the same Tib. rendering, and that
khelu would be an easy graphic corruption for *svelu
(which could also easily be corrupted to śvelu). But cf.
also prec., and {@rolā@}.
