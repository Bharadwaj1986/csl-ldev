{@agha@}¦, m. (= Pali id.), ({@1@}) {%sky, atmosphere%}; only in
{@aghaniṣṭha@}, q.v.; ({@2@}) in the {@lokāntarikā@} (q.v.) passage,
aghā aghasaṃvṛtā(ḥ) or aghasphuṭā(ḥ) (or other cpd.)
means {%miseries (? miserable) and enclosed by%} ({%full of%}, or the
like) {%miseries%}; so essentially Senart, Mv i note 405 f.
We could perhaps recognize the first agha as an adj. (so
in RV and once in BhāgP.); but it seems more likely that
it is the more familiar noun, which esp. in Pali often means
{%misery%}. In the Pali version (CPD s.v. ^2agha, end) we
should read aghā aghasaṃvutā, as Senart perceived
(texts asaṃvutā, a very old corruption); or at least, that
[Page005-b+ 71]
must have been the original version. The CPD assumes
an otherwise unknown adj. agha, {%aerial, without support%},
which is inappropriate and implausible.
