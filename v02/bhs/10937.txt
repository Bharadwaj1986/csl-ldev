{@bāhiraka@}¦ (cf. prec.; = Pali id.), {%external%}, but in
BHS noted only in the special mg. {%outside (the Buddhist%}
{%religion), non-Buddhist, heretical%}: brāhmaṇo °rako Mv
iii.223.4; with tīrthya, Śikṣ 332.9; in Pali with -pabbajjā
and -tittha in this sense; in BHS esp. with mārga, {%a non-%}
{%Buddhist (religious) path%}, °keṇa mārgeṇa Mv i.284.1;
ii.210.7 (by em.); iii.450.9; and read so in ii.30.11; 48.19;
iii.152.11, in which Senart keeps the corruption bāhitakena
(or vāh°) mārgeṇa, inconsistently (the phrase is obviously
the same and must be read in the same way; Senart,
i n. 431 and 587, expresses the belief that the true reading
is °taka, but fails to act on it in the first three passages
above; Pali bāhiraka helps to prove him wrong). For
the general sense cf. bahidhānugatāḥ s.v. {@bahidhā@}.
