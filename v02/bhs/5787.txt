{@gupti@}¦, f., in Mv nt. in form (n. sg. °tiṃ), in Mv
sometimes written {@gupta@}, nt., seems to be false Sktization
of the word which appears in Pali as kutti, apparently =
Skt. kḷpti, {%form, formation, fashion%}: note esp. svara-gupti =
Pali sara-kutti (Jāt. vi.293.19; Vin. ii.108.18, comm.
1202.6 = sara-kiriyā), {%form%} (timbre? so Lévi, JAs. 1915,
I, 404 n.) {%of voice%}, Bbh 61.(18--)20 (yādṛśī teṣāṃ varṇa-
puṣkalatā bhavati, tādṛśī tasya; yādṛśa āroha-pariṇāhaḥ,
tādṛśas tasya bhavati;) yādṛśī svara-guptis teṣāṃ, tādṛśī
tasya bhavati (Chin. acc. to Wogihara {%sound%}, i.e. perhaps
{%timbre, of words%}); very similarly Divy 222.21 (Indra made
Mūrdhāta like himself; there was no difference between
them, na…nānākaraṇaṃ vā yad utāroha-)pariṇāho (so
read with mss., as in Bbh; ed. em. °hau) varṇapuṣkalatā
svara-guptyā svaragupter nānyatra…; see also s.v.
{@guptikā@}; in Mv a dozen times in a cliché where gupti
(sometimes written gupta) is parallel and synonymous
with liṅga, dhvaja, and kalpa (sometimes ākalpa; cf.
Jāt. vi.293.19 ākappaṃ sara-kuttiṃ vā na rañño sadisam
ācare); with minor variants the cliché reads yaṃ (yat)
kiṃci(d) gṛhi- (or ṛṣi-, parivrājaka-, tīrthika-)-liṅgaṃ
gṛhi-(etc.)-guptiṃ (mss. sometimes guptaṃ, very rarely
guptiḥ; Senart sometimes em. gupti) gṛhi-(etc.)-dhvajaṃ
gṛhi-(etc.)-kalpaṃ (mss. sometimes ākalpaṃ) sarvaṃ
(sam-)antar(a)hitaṃ (antarahāye), describing sudden and
miraculous changes in heretics upon their conversion--
they suddenly appear like Buddhist monks: Mv ii.234.(3--) 4;
iii.65.(3--)4; 92.(8--)9; 180.14; 181.5; 329.11; 379.14;
413.(11--)12; 423.8; 430.16; 432.2; here prob. belongs also
ācāra-gupti-kuhaka(ḥ) śramaṇaḥ KP 121.3; 123.1, 8;
ācāraguptiḥ kuhako 126.12; here Tib. renders literally,
(hypocritical) {%while guarding%} (propriety of conduct); as
KP 123 makes clear in detail, it refers to a monk who
[Page213-b+ 71]
goes thru all the external proper forms of behavior but
for interested, selfish motives (hence kuhaka); 2d and 3d
Chin. translations render ācāra-gupti by {%(having) dignity%}
{%of demeanor%}, and prob. gupti really meant {%external form%},
as very clearly in Mv. See next but one, and cf. {@gutti@}
(for Skt. gupti, in a different sense).
