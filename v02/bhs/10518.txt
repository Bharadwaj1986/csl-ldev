{@pravicārayati, °reti@}¦ (see prec. two; in Skt. {%investigates%}
{%fully, becomes well cognizant of, knows well%}, and so in BHS,
e.g. Dbh.g. 44(70).10, see s.v. {@paricārayati@} 3), {%amuses%}
{%oneself%}, especially (but not exclusively) sexually with
women; in this sense the verb is unrecorded outside of
BHS, and almost limited to Mv; but see prec. two items
for AMg. and JM. related nouns; as Senart points out, i
note 396, this seems to be somehow due to confusion with
{@paricārayati@} (1) with which its use is identical; but it
occurs once in LV, and too often in Mv to be emended,
esp. in view of the noun relatives in AMg. and JM.; nārīhi
pravicāreti Mv iii.8.17; almost always, like paricārayati
(1), follows forms of krīḍati and ramati (°te), so (not always
of sexual pleasure) LV 72.18; Mv i.31.6 (repeated with
paricār° 32.6); 32.8; ii.111.15, 16; 144.10, 13; 146.6; 151.6;
170.14; 171.16; 444.12; iii.37.10, 11; 162.10; caus. in
force, suṣṭhu kumāraṃ krīḍāpetha ramāpetha pravicā-
rayetha (so mss., Senart em. °cārāpetha) Mv ii.151.13,
{%amuse the prince…%}; pass. (cf. Pali paricāriyati to pari-
cāreti) {%is entertained%}: devī Māyā…sukhaiḥ pravicāryate
Mv i.99.3.
