{@niḥsaraṇa@}¦ (cf. also {@a-niḥ°, niḥsṛti@}; often written
niḥśar°; = Pali nissaraṇa), nt. (in Mvy 1201 m. in Kyoto
ed., but nt. in Mironov), {%escape%} (from the world), {%salvation%};
in this sense only lex. in Skt., where the word is however
standardly used as (means of) {%riddance%} (from anything).
It has this mg. also in BHS; esp. {%getting rid%} of evil or
misfortune, as Bhīk 28b.5, MSV iii.7.15 {%escape%} from
religious punishment; or {%riddance%} from sins, Mvy 1597 ff.;
Śikṣ 64.14; 191.7 āpattiṣu niḥśaraṇajñānam (Translation
wrong); jara-niḥs° {%from old age%} LV 174.18; more generally
loka-niḥs° {%from the world%} Gv 191.25; bhavaniḥsaraṇe (so
read with v.l. and citation Śikṣ 203.16 [ś for s] for Lefm.
bhavani saraṇe, unmetr.) LV 173.12, {%from existence%}. The
last two mean virtually {%salvation%}, mokṣa, and show how hard
it is to draw a clear line between the standard Skt. and
the specialized Pali-BHS mg. Substantially {%salvation%} is
the mg. in LV 346.2 asya…duḥkhaskandhasya niḥśara-
ṇam, {%salvation from this%} (world which is a)…{%mass of%}
{%misery%}; Mv i.73.6 so hi niḥsaraṇam (all mss. s, Senart ś)
uttamaṃ prabhuḥ, {%he, the Lord, is the supreme salvation%};
i.180.5 niḥśaraṇajñaś ca (here all mss. ś, Senart em. sl;
he also em. wrongly °jñasya); ii.418.8; Mvy 853 anantakal-
pakoṭī-niḥsaraṇa-kuśalaḥ, {%skilled in%} (attaining) {%salvation%}
{%after endless crores of kalpas%} (said of a Bodhisattva); Divy
616.23; Śikṣ 236.7; KP 64.8; sa-niḥsaraṇam Bbh 219.4, 8,
of dharma, {%containing%} (bringing) {%salvation%}; niḥsaraṇa-
prajña (= Pali nissaraṇa-pañña; -prajña can be defended
as Bhvr., {%having knowledge of salvation%}, but may also be a
MIndicism, cf. -prājña below) {%knowing salvation%} Mvy 1105
(of śrāvakas); Mv iii.201.6; niḥśaraṇa-prājña (so with 1
ms.; Tatpuruṣa), id., Mv iii.52.5; others, see {@a-niḥsaraṇa@}.
