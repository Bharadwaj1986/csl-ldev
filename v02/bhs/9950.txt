{@pratikrośa@}¦ (m.? to next; cf. Pali paṭikkosana),
{%rejection, scorn, disregard%}: °śena AsP 179.6 (prose; refers
to action of 179.4, see next); {%rejection of, opposition to%},
action in the saṃgha, MSV ii.210.5, 9 ff. In Mv ii.371.10
(vs) Senart reads sukhito pramuditaḥ pratikrośaṃ pratila-
bhati purimanirodhadṛṣṭaṃ, and interprets prati° as
[Page362-a+ 71]
referring to the contempt and ill-treatment which pious
men will accept with joy in the time of decadence of
religion; but this does not seem a natural interpretation,
and the mss. read, one, prītiḥ krośaṃ, the other prati-
kośaṃ; combining parts of each we would get prīti-
kośaṃ, {%a treasure-store of joy%}, which makes good sense
and which I would read. The meter is very puzzling to
me in this whole passage, so that I cannot rely on it.
