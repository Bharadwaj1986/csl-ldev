{@varjayati@}¦, in phrase ārdravṛkṣe vā (or va) varjayitvā
(varjetvā, varjitvā) Mv i.7.5; 11.12; 17.9; 20.12; 24.9 (or
°vṛkṣeṣu varjitāḥ 12.15, mss.), object being the wicked in
various hells, subject their tormentors; acc. to Senart (note
375) {%rejetant, repoussant%} (les damnés) {%sous un arbre verdoyant%}
(they tear or devour their flesh, or the like). I venture
to guess that it means {%impaling%} them {%on a fresh, green%}
{%tree%} (stump or branch). But I cannot explain this mg. in
terms of varj-or ā-varj-; vā (almost always preceding the
gerund) is also difficult (Senart assumes it stands for eva);
I suspect some corruption.
