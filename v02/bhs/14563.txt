{@vairocana, (1)@}¦ (= Pali vero°, Skt. viro°) {%the sun%}:
°naṃ vā gagaṇasmiṃ sarvaraśmisamāgataṃ arcitvā…
Mv ii.304.9 (vs); °nasya jagato viśiṣṭā ābhā (Senart adds
abhū) bhaviṣyati kiṃ tu adya Mv ii.316.9 (vs); this is
prob. the mg. of the first member of many of the cpd.
proper names which follow this entry; ({@2@}) (cf. Pali 2
Verocana in DPPN, n. of a certain jewel; AMg. vairoyaṇa,
{%fire%}; and see {@virocana@} 1), a certain jewel (also {@viro°@}):
°nāṃ maṇiratnāṃ grahetvā Mv ii.317.13 (vs); °na-maṇi-
ratna- Gv 101.12 (prose; -padmagarbhāṇi); 159.1 (prose;
vitāna-vitataṃ); ({@3@}) n. of one (the first) of the five
‘transcendent’ Buddhas: Dharmas 3 (first of ‘five Buddhas’);
Mvy 82 (foll. by the other four of Dharmas 3, at the head
of a list of names of Tathāgatas) = Tib. rnam par snaṅ
mdzad; once replaced by {@Kāyeśa@}, q.v.; Sādh 16.9 etc.
(same group of five); he is prob. identical with the Vairo-
cana who occurs in Śākyamuni's place in the standard
series of Buddhas (after Kāśyapa) Gv 298.6; the standard
story of Śākyamuni's birth in the Lumbinī grove is told
of Vai°, Gv 379.24 ff.; 381.5, with the usual personnel,
Māyā, Gopā, etc.; mentioned with Gopā but not as her
husband, 396.23; other refs., see s.v. {@Māyā@} (1); and cf.
P. Mus, Barabudur, p. 584; a Tathāgata of this name
mentioned in several earlier passages of Gv, e.g. 40.1;
277.23; 290.23, with what seems to be special respect,
may be identified with the V. just described, and so prob.
with the ‘transcendent’ Buddha; in Gv 82.12 the last of
a list of Buddhas the first of which is Amitābha, but the
others mostly unknown; ({@4@}) prob. not to be identified
with the prec., n. of one or more former (in Mmk perhaps
contemporary) Buddhas: LV 171.10 (vs; Lefm. {@Virocana@}
(3), most mss. Vai°, metr. indifferent); Mmk 64.2; Gv
104.18; ({@5@}) n. of a future Buddha: Mv iii.330.15; ({@6@}) n.
of a cakravartin, former incarnation of Maitreya: Mv
i.59.2, 13; ({@7@}) n. of a {@nīlakāyika@} (q.v.) devaputra: LV
383.11; ({@8@}) n. of a samādhi: Mvy 536; ŚsP 1417.12.
