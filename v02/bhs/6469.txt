{@? jantāka@}¦ (m. or nt.) is read once or twice in Av
(i.286.9, 10, see Speyer's note on i.286.8) for jentāka, see
s.v. {@jenta@}; and jaṃdāka(-snātra) is written in one of the
Niya documents, see Rapson and Noble, Kharoṣṭhī In-
scriptions (Stein collection), vol. 3, p. 321, where it is
suggested that jantāka be adopted in Av; but Av i.286.8
has je-, supporting Mvy and Karmav.
