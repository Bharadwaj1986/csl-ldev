{@tathādarśana@}¦, adj. Bhvr. (evidently = {@evaṃdar-@}
{@śana, °dṛṣṭi@}), {%holding such a view%}: Mv ii.120.17 (sa) cāhaṃ
bhikṣavo tathādarśanato evaṃ va (one ms. omits va)
[Page249-a+ 71]
samāno yena gayānagaraṃ tad avasāri, {%and, O monks%}
(realizing the worthlessness of the doctrine of Rāma,
taught by his son), {%from the holder of such a doctrine%} (viz.
from Udraka Rāmaputra), {%being just as I was, I went off%}
{%to Gayā-city%}; in ii.119.6 we should expect a close parallel,
in which the Bodhisattva leaves Ārāḍa Kālāma, but the
text seems corrupt: sa khalv ahaṃ bhikṣavo tathādar-
śanāya (so, or °nāyai, mss.; Senart em. °nāyaiva; required
is rather °nato, prob. followed by evaṃ va) samāno, etc.
(he goes to Rājagṛha). (Otherwise Senart; ignoring the
Bhvr. nature of the cpd. which seems guaranteed by
evaṃdarśana, °dṛṣṭi.) Also Mv ii.123.16 (prose) sa khalv
ahaṃ…tathādarśanasamāno, {%I being of this opinion%} (as
just stated in prec.).
