{@kālāpadeśa@}¦, m. (see {@apadeśa@}), acc. to Tib. cited
by Wogihara {%‘black doctrine’%}, nag-po bstan pa; but this
can hardly be right; perhaps {%‘timely expression’%}; something
which a Bodhisattva must know, along with {@mahāpadeśa@}
(of which the precise mg. is also unknown; Tib. renders
literally): Bbh 108.10--11 °śa-mahāpadeśāṃś ca yathābhū-
taṃ prajānāti; 257.2 °śaṃ ca mahāpadeśaṃ ca yathā°
praj°; 108.25 °śa-mahāpadeśa-kuśalo bodhisattvaḥ.
