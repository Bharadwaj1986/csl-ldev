jarāṃ ca upadeśenti, na caiṣāṃ vidyate jarā; and
19, ārabdham (? mss. alabdhi) upadeśenti eṣā lokānu-
vartanā (see {@anuvartanā@}). Similarly 170.2 (they are not
born or begotten, yet) mātāpitṛñ ca deśenti eṣā lokānu-
vartanā; 170.10 alpotsukatvaṃ pradeśenti eṣā°. The mg.
is regular for Skt. deśayati and for upadiśati, pradiśati,
but not recorded for the causatives of the two latter.
Nevertheless it seems necessary to keep the mss. readings,
rather than read (upa-, pra-)darśenti, as Senart in his
note was tempted to do (and that altho forms of darśayati
are similarly used in the context, e.g. 170.4, 6).
