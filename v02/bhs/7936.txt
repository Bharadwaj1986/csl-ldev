{@dhuta-dharma@}¦, m. pl. (= {@dhuta, °guṇa, dhūta-@}
{@guṇa:@} cf. Pali dhammaṃ dhutaṃ Sn 385, but the sequel
shows that this is not used in the technical sense of Pali
dhutaṅga; it is very vague and general; Childers cites a dhū-
ta-dhamma but his references fail to show it), {%the qualities%}
{%of the purified man%}: °māḥ RP 33.1 (vs); the disciple Kāśyapa
is regularly called dhutadharma-dhara, {%maintainer of the…%},
Mv i.85.11 ff.; 105.12, 13, or the like, as °rma-dhārin Mv
i.66.16; °rma-samaṅgin (see {@samaṅgin@}) i.71.16; in i.69.13
(vs) Senart reads evam ukte dhutadharmaviśuddho (Kā-
śyapo…), mss. °rma-su-viśuddhaṃ; the syllable su is
hypermetric, but the acc. °dhaṃ (tho certainly referring
to K.) could perhaps stand as goal of ukte, {%it having been%}
{%thus spoken to the one-that-was-purified-in-the-dhutadharma,%}
{%K%}. (replied); Kāśyapa has similar epithets involving
dhutaguṇa (dhū°), a fact which establishes their equi-
valence of mg. with dhutadharma; and see also {@dhuta-@}
{@dhara@}. Similarly in Pali, Mahā-Kassapa in AN i.23.19 is
called dhuta-vādānaṃ (v.l. dhutaṅga-dharāṇaṃ) agga.
