{@Mati, (1)@}¦ n. of a prince, son of the Buddha Candra-
sūryapradīpa: SP 19.2; ({@2@}) n. of a brahman youth, pre-
vious incarnation of Dharmaruci; corresponds to {@Megha-@}
{@datta@} of Mv, Megha of Pali, as associate of the previous
incarnation of Śākyamuni (here called {@Sumati@}) under
Dīpaṃkara: Divy 247.2 ff.; ({@3@}) n. of a prince, previous
incarnation of Śākyamuni (is this the same as Sumati of
Divy?): Samādh p. 52 lines 21 (here text satī, read mati)
and 30; ({@4@}) n. of a teacher (a Buddha?) in the kṛta yuga:
Laṅk 365.3; also called {@Mahāmati@} (5); in 365.7 apparently
a different Mati (a Buddha, nāyakaḥ) is named, a later
one, tho still in the kṛta yuga (Suzuki's transl. is wrong
on this).
