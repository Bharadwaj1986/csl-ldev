{@cāpodara@}¦, {%having a belly%} (slender) {%like a bow%}, one of
the {@anuvyañjana@}, replacing {@kṣāmodara@} (No. 36) in LV
107.4, and by Senart's em. in Mv ii.44.3 (see kṣāmodara).
Tib. renders LV rked pa gzhu-ḥi ḥchaṅ bzuṅ ltar phra
ba, which, if I understand it correctly, seems to mean
{%with waist slender like the handle (?) of a bow%}; at least the
words gzhu, {%bow%}, and phra, {%slender%}, seem clear, and
suggest that Tib. rendered both cāpa and kṣāma; in
another context Mvy 5207 has cāpodarī, fem., rendered
rked pa gzhu-ḥi chaṅ gzuṅs, {%waist%} (like) {%handle (?) of bow%},
or bzuṅ ltar phra ba, {%slender like handle%} (?); Chin. {%waist%}
{%like handle of bow%}.
