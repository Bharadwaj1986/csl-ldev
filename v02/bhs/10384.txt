{@? prabudhyati@}¦, or {@°te@} (so mss.), perh. {%is taught%} or
{%proclaimed%}: nāmena vaipulyam idaṃ pra° (KN em.
pravucyati, kept by WT without note) SP 23.10 (vs);
Tib. does not seem to render any verb; Kern {%which by%}
{%name is called%} (adopting the em.?); Burnouf {%il expliqua%}
(active verbs, of which Buddha is the subject, precede
and follow, but it seems not impossible to take this as
passive: {%this sūtra of great extent is taught by name as…%});
na cāpi nirvāṇam (text °ṇām) idaṃ prabudhyati SP 62.16
(vs), so all Nep. mss. reported; WT pravucyati, citing Ḱ
as pravuceti.
