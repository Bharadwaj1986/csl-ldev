{@parijñāta-bhojana@}¦, adj. Bhvr. (= Pali pariñ-
ñāta-bh°), {%having true knowledge about food%}: pratyeka-
buddho pari° sarvāśuciparikṣīṇo mahābhāgo Mv i.302.9;
ye °janā(ḥ) Ud xxix.35 = Pali Dhp. 92 ye pariññāta-
bhojanā, expl. in comm. ii.172.1 ff. as {%having the three%}
{%pariññā%}, viz. ñāta-pa°, knowing what the food is that
he is eating; tīraṇa-pa°, keeping in mind while eating
that food is repulsive; and pahāna-pa°, keeping in mind
