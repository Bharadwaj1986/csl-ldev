{@ratna@}¦ (or MIndic {@ratana@}), nt. (m. forms, see § 6.10),
{%jewel, gem%}, as in Skt.; ({@1@}) three (Buddha, dharma, saṃgha,
as in Pali): Dharmas 1, etc.; see {@triratna, ratna-traya;@}
{@(2)@} seven precious substances, or their respective colors,
suvarṇa, rūpya, muktā, vaiḍūrya, sphaṭika (or sphā°),
{@musāragalva@} (or variants, see s.v.), {@lohitikā:@} Mv i.49.10
--11; 63.1; 194.5, 19; 195.9; 249.6; iii.226.10; 227.6; 323.16;
a different list of seven, muktāmaṇi, vaiḍūrya, śaṅkhaśilā,
pravāla, sphaṭika, musāragalva, lohitikā, Mv ii.472.1; the
usual list in other texts is nearly like Mv i.49.10 etc.,
but omits muktā, and for Nos. 5--7 (6 and 7 of Mv) has
{@lohitamukti@}, aśmagarbha, {@musāragalva:@} SP 151.1;
153.3; Divy 297.23 ff.; Gv 52.15; 161.16; in SP 239.7
sphaṭika is omitted, karketana added at the end, and the
order is abnormal; in Pali no standard list of 7 ratana
seems recorded except in the lex. Abhidh.p., which is
cited in Childers and PTSD as suvaṇṇa, rajata, muttā,
maṇi, veḷuriya, vajira, pavāḷa (Miln. 267.23 ff., cited by
PTSD, is not apposite, since this list far exceeds seven
in number); yet seven ratnanāni (unspecified) are several
times mentioned in Pali (PTSD); ({@3@}) fig., the seven
{%‘jewels’%} of a cakravartin, viz. cakra, hastin, aśva, maṇi,
strī, gṛhapati, {@pariṇāyaka@} (same list in Pali forms also);
see Senart, Légende du Buddha (1st ed.), 20 ff.: LV 14.5
and ff., full descriptions of each ratna; also MSV i.31.16 ff.,
in great detail; lists, Mvy 3621--8; Dharmas 85 (here,
aberrantly, khaḍga instead of gṛhapati); Mv i.49.3; 108.5 ff.
(account of how they are acquired, by previous deeds of
merit); 193.16; ii.158.16; iii.107.5; Divy 548.24 ff.; ({@4@}) m.,
n. of a former Buddha: Mv i.62.16 (prose); later called
{@Rat(a)navant@}, q.v.
