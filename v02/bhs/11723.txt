{@Mahādeva, (1)@}¦ n. of a king, of the race of Mahāsaṃ-
mata and corresp. to Pali Makhādeva(!): Mvy 3582; MSV
i.111.19 ff.; ({@2@}) n. of a prince, son of Mahāratha and
[Page423-a+ 71]
brother of Mahāsattva: Suv 206.12; 225.13 ff.; ({@3@}) n. of
a god: Gv 218.6 ff.; perhaps understood as the same as
Skt. Mahādeva (Śiva); but his residence is {@Dvāravatī@}
(q.v.), and he has four arms (219.1); both things suggest
Kṛṣṇa.
