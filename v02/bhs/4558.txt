(vs) kāśikapratyāstaraṇaṃ (? em.; mss. °tyottaraṇaṃ)
suvicitra-kalandakaṃ (so 1 ms., the other °ṇḍakaṃ;
Senart em. wrongly) maṇivicitraṃ; ii.38.3 (vs) read
essentially with mss.: atha kanaka-m-aṣṭapādā suvicitra-
kalandakā (or, with mss., °ntakā-ḥ?) maṇivicitrā (? mss.
°tro or °tra); ii.470.8, for Senart's em. kilaṃjakā (pi
kriyanti) mss. seem to intend karaṃjakā; context fits
our word as to mg.; note, however, that in the next line
(9) mss. have karantā (Senart em. karaṇḍā) pi kriyanti,
which might be meant for kalanta(ka), or be another
form of the word here concerned.
