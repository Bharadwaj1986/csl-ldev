{@Velāma, (1)@}¦ n. of a brahman who gave advice to
{@Piṇḍavaṃśa:@} MSV i.64.19 ff. There is a curious resem-
blance between his advice to P., which the latter followed,
and the reputation of Pali Velāma (see DPPN); ({@2@}) n. of
a brahman who was a generous giver (doubtless = Pali
id.): MSV i.98.12.
