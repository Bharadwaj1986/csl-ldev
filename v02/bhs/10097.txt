{@prativikalpa@}¦, m., {%separate%} (and false) {%discrimination,%}
{%making distinctions where fundamentally none exist%}; in
Laṅk seems interchangeable with {@parikalpa@}, etc., see
Suzuki, Studies, Glossary s.v. (where pratikalpa is also
cited, but this is not in Suzuki's Index, and I have not
noted it) and Index to Laṅk: bālaprativikalpam upādāya
Laṅk 17.12, etc. Cf. next.
