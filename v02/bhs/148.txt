{@aghaniṣṭha@}¦, doubtless understood as {%sky-based%} (see
{@agha@}, 1), a class of gods: Mvy 3107, where it follows
{@akaniṣṭha@}, of which it is surely nothing but a folk-ety-
mological distortion. So Wogihara, Lex. It occurs in no
other of my texts unless in Bbh; Wogihara reads so in
62.6 and 68.5; actually it is read only in the latter place
by one of the two mss. (which reads aniṣṭha in the former
place), while the other ms. reads akaniṣṭha both times.
Wogihara's suggested interpretation, and those he quotes
from Yaśomitra and Chin., seem to me fantastic and
worthless. Cf. {@lokaniṣṭha@}.
