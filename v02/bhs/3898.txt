{@ubhayato-bhāga-vimukta@}¦, adj. (= Pali ubhato-
bhāga-vimutta), {%emancipated from both parts%}: Mvy 1028
(misprinted °bhaga°; corr. Index); Divy 404.24 (read:
ubhau hi tau ubhayatobhāgavimuktau); Bhīk 27b.1; cf.
AbhidhK. LaV-P. ii.205; vi.275--7. Often edd. (Pali and
BHS) print ubha(ya)to as separate word, wrongly; it
modifies bhāga- directly, as part of the cpd. Tib. on Mvy
gñis kaḥi cha las…{%from both parts%}; Pali MN comm.
iii.188.7 = DN comm. ii.514.3 dvīhi bhāgehi vimutto,
arūpasamāpattiyā rūpakāyato vimutto, maggena nāma-
kāyato (i.e. from the skhandha other than rūpa) vimutto.
The AbhidhK. vi.276 has a different interpretation acc.
to LaV-P., {%delivered from the obstacle of the passions%} (impu-
rities, kleśāvaraṇa), {%and from the obstacle to%} (the 8) {%vimokṣa%}
(which is stated to be akarmaṇyatā, {%l'impuissance corporelle%}
[Page148-a+ 71]
{%et mentale%}). This seems to be a later reinterpretation; the
Pali comms. make it simpler, referring to the {%physical%}
and {%mental%} constituents. Which was meant in our texts
is not clear from the contexts.
