{@vihāra@}¦, m. (Pali id.), in BHS chiefly in two mgs.,
both seemingly based on the meaning {%dwelling%} (to {@viharati@},
q.v.), ({@1@}) {%dwelling place%} of monks, esp. of a monkish
community, {%monastery%}; so used also in Skt.: in this sense
= Tib. gtsug lag khaṅ, {%house of sciences%}, because schools
were associated with monasteries, Mvy 9096; 9152; ({@2@})
= Tib. gnas (pa), as for {@viharati@}, {%state of being, stage%} or
{%condition of existence%}; sukhasparśa-vihāra-tā Mvy 6288;
{@brahma-vi°@}, q.v.; see s.v. {@viharati@} for examples; others
praviṣṭamānasya śubhair vihārair LV 7.2 (vs), prob. {%being%}
{%entered into%} (instr. = loc.) {%fair states%}; mayā pramatta-
vihārāye na samanvāhṛtaṃ (so read with mss.) Mv iii.355.1,

dwelling, Vairocanavyūhālaṃkāragarbha) śūnyatānimit-
tāpraṇihita-vihāra-vihāriṇām āvāsaḥ Gv 469.25, and long
list of similar formulae, all with cpds. ending -vihāra-
vihāriṇāṃ, {%the abode of those who dwell in the state of…%};
yat Tathāgataḥ tribhir…apratisamair vihāraiḥ tadba-
hula-vihārī, āryeṇa vihāreṇa, divyena, brāhmeṇa; iyam
asya vihāraparamatety ucyate. tatra śūnyatānimittā-

(= {@brahmavihāra@}) brāhmo vi°…Bbh 90.7--13; twelve
bodhisattva-vihāra, listed and explained at length in the
‘vihāra-chapter (paṭala)’ of Bbh, 317.5, 10 ff. (there is a
13th, the tāthāgato vi°, niruttaro vi°, 12--14), listed 15 ff.,
gotra-vi°, adhimukticaryā-vi°, pramudita-vi°, adhiśīla-vi°,
etc. (the long chapter must be read to understand the terms
which by themselves sound obscure); ten jñānapāramitā-
vihāra, Gv 537.11 ff. (listed); in Bbh 332.20 ff. the standard
10 bodhisattva-{@bhūmi@} (q.v.) are called b°-vihārāḥ (line
23); cf. Sūtrāl. xx-xxi. 14 comm., ekādaśa vihārā ekādaśa
bhūmayaḥ (the 11th is the buddha-bhūmi); ({@3@}) prob.
{%walking%} (as in Skt.), in two almost identical passages in
Divy: padā vihāra 78.6 ff. and 467.2 ff., also in MSV
i.75.21 ff. (printed as cpd.), and iii.140.9, 19, {%walking,%}
{%marching on foot%} (refers to passing around a holy place to
the right, Divy 78.5, 467.1); below, mālāvihāraḥ kṛtaḥ
Divy 78.25 and 467.26, and ff., and MSV i.76.18 ff., {%a%}
{%garland-perambulation%} (?), precise mg. not clear to me;
it is obviously some form of homage to the holy spot, more
elaborate than the depositing of loose flowers (mukta-
puṣpāṇi Divy 78.18; 467.18).
