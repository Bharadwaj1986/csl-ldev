<L>10095<pc>368,1<k1>प्रतिवाणि<k2>प्रतिवाणि, °णी
{@prativāṇi, °ṇī@}¦, f. (and {@°ṇi@}, nt.?; cf. {@a-prati°@}, which
see for Pali correspondents), {%opposition, repulsion, aversion%}
to spoken words, especially to preaching or teaching;
apparently a cpd. of prati and vāṇī: °ṇī, n. sg., AsP 244.20,
and °ṇiḥ, id., 484.7, both in reference to preaching or
teaching; prativāṇi (? Mironov °ni without v.l., and Kyoto
ed. suggests that their mss. read °ni, and that their °ṇi
in text is an em.; cf. however aprativāṇi, where both edd.
have °ṇi) Mvy 5239 = Tib. mi ḥphrod pa, {%unsuitable,%}
{%disagreeable%} or the like; prob. of attitude towards teaching
(the preceding entry is śaikṣābhir nikūjitaṃ). Form dubi-
ous; ending seems confirmed by aprativāṇi; n. sg. nt.?
Or possibly adverb? In pw 7.360 °vāṇi by em., rendered
{%Opposition%}, which I think is about right.
