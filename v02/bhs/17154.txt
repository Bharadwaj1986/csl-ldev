{@suvarṇa-saṃdhi@}¦ (f. or nt., acc. to text), {%a ‘golden’%}
(i.e. advantageous) {%alliance%} (by marriage): °dhī ca (v.l.
va) kṛtā putrapautrikā Mv ii.490.19 (prose), {%and golden%}
{%alliances%} (with seven kings, by intermarriage) {%were made%}
{%for his sons and grandsons%} (i.e. to hold for all future time);
Senart here deletes suvarṇa; but in the repetition iii.24.11
he keeps it, reading °saṃdhīva (rather °dhī ca, with text
above) putrapautrā (but here mss. °traṃ, as if °saṃdhi
were nt.). The same incident is described both times.
