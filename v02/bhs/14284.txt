{@viṣṭhā?@}¦ in Divy 274.22, acc. to Index {%rope%} (i.e.
{%lasso%}), but all that is clear is that it is some means of
catching and holding: nedaṃ kenacid viṣṭhayā vā śiṭayā
(see {@śiṭā@}) vā karkaṭakena vā gṛhītavyaṃ. Possibly read
ciṣṭhayā or ciṣṭayā = AMg. ciṭṭhā, with MIndic i for e,
= Skt. ceṣṭā, {%with movements%} (of the hands, etc.); but this
is naturally doubtful.
