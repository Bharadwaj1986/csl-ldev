({@sāṃparāya@}¦, m., or nt., = Skt. id. = BHS and Pali
{@saṃparāya@}, q.v. The definition in BR is not happy;
{%future life%} or {%state%} is the mg. in Skt. The Sktized form
occurs in BHS, e.g. Ud v.25 sāṃparāye, in contrast with
dṛṣṭe dharme; and in Mv iii.214.17; 218.6; 222.9; in these
gamanīyo (or °yaṃ) sāṃparāyaḥ (or °yaṃ, as if nt.) is
read instead of {@saṃparāyaḥ@}, q.v., which occurs in the
same phrase near by. See also {@saṃparāyika@} and next.)
