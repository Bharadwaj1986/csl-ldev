{@Kātyāyana@}¦ (= Pali Kaccāyana, Kaccāna; occurs
Mv iii.382.13 and Divy 635.15 as n. of a brahmanical
gotra, as in Skt.; perhaps the same is that mentioned
Laṅk 361.1 as the gotra of the Buddha {@Viraja@} 2, q.v.),
n. of an important disciple of the Buddha (Śākyamuni):
Mv i.76.5 ff. (here he is made to deliver a discourse on the
ten bhūmi); SP 152.3; Divy 11.29; 550.2; identical with
{@Mahākātyāyana@}, which is commoner; in Divy 573.8 he
appears to have the epithet (Ārya-) {@Kāśyapa@}, q.v. (or
are they different persons?); Kātyāyanāvavāda MPS
29.15 (see Waldschmidt, p. 284 n.6).
