{@abhimanyati@}¦, with acc. or dat. (loc. ?), in Mv ii.440.15--
17, used four times of the attitude of a husband or wife
towards a very ugly spouse; perhaps {%is hostile towards%}
(as in Skt.), but {%despises, contemns%}, or perhaps {%loathes%}
would seem more natural: (14) anyam-anyam (15) °yanti,
…patiṃ °yati, (16)…patiḥ pāparūpāye bhāryāye
abhimanyati, (17)…yā te putra nābhimanyiṣyati. Cf. next.
