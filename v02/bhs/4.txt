{@-aṃśika@}¦ (cf. 1 {@aṃśa@}, 2), ifc., {%belonging to the part%}
{%of; pertaining to%}; sometimes with vṛddhi of first syllable
of prior member of cpd.: maraṇāṃśika Mvy 5345, upa-
pattyaṃśika 5346, {%belonging to (the part of) death, birth%};
Tib. char gtogs pa, {%included in the division of%} (Das); aupa-
pattyaṃśika = upa° Śikṣ 226.7 ff. (Śāl 87.10 ff.); 253.3,
5. Equivalent to -aṃśika are {@-antika@} in māraṇāntika
Śikṣ 226.7 ff. (same passage Śāl) and {@-aṅgika@} in aupa-
pattyaṅgika Laṅk 277.6 (said of citta). It is natural to
suspect that corruption of tradition is responsible for
one or two of these. But (1) all can be plausibly explained
as of independent origin; (2) -aṃśika is well authenticated,
while -antika is supported by Pali (māraṇantika Miln.
48.11).
