{@ṛṇa-dhara@}¦ or {@°hara, °hāraka@}, adj., in cliché said
after birth of a son, jāto 'smākam ṛṇaharo (254.11 °dharo;
87.17 °hārako) dhanaharo (om. 498.21; 87.18 °hārakaś ca)
Divy 87.17--18; 254.11; 301.10; 498.20--21; MSV i.87.5.
After saying this, the father announces his intention of
going on a business trip to make money. The situation
suggests ṛṇadhara, {%debt-establisher%}, and dhanahara, {%remover%}
{%of wealth%}; i.e. a financial liability; cf. AMg. aṇa-dhāraga,
rendered {%debtor%} (Ratnach., Sheth). But (a) ṛṇahara
rather than ṛṇadhara, (or else ṛṇahāraka,) is read every
time but once (h MIndic for dh?); and (b) in Divy 5.12
mahāsamudram avatīrṇo dhanahārakaḥ, the latter means
{%to get wealth%} (see {@hāraka@}; Index {%with money%}, not accurately);
similarly, mahāsamudram avatareyaṃ dhanahārikaḥ (read
°rakaḥ? but cf. s.v. {@-hārika@}) Divy 100.28. Not clear.
