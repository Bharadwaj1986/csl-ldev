{@jitam@}¦, apparently interj. or particle, chiefly in phrase:
api hi jitaṃ Mv ii.126.9; iii.181.14; 206.10, 12; 209.12;
this seems to be an expression of {%astonishment%}, something
like {%Who'd have thought it ? That beats all!%} Once, in Mv
iii.286.1, jitaṃ (v.l. jidaṃ) occurs by itself; the daughters
of Māra, reporting to Māra, say: (any other man than
the Bodhisattva, seeing us,) so jitaṃ mūrchitvā prapatiṣyad
vā…cittakṣayaṃ vā prāpuṇe (but the B. was unmoved);
here too {%astonishment%} might be the connotation of the
particle; {%he, good heavens! would have fallen down fainting%}
{%…, or lost his wits%}. No etymology is apparent for the
word.
