[{@tadāhiṃ@}¦ is apparently understood by Senart as
meaning {%then%} in Mv ii.69.5 (prose), yadā bhagavāṃ pravṛt-
tadharmacakro tadāhiṃ etaṃ bhikṣubhi śrutaṃ. But mss.
tadā hi or tadā hi-m-(i.e., I suppose, ‘hiatus-bridging’ m
before following vowel); I think the particle hi must be
assumed, after tadā. Perhaps Senart assumed a blend of
tadā with (e)tar(a)hi(ṃ).]
