{@ājavaṃjava@}¦ (m. or nt.), {%coming and going, moving%}
{%to and fro%} (in the saṃsāra): Mvy 5393 °va- (Mironov
ājāvaṃ°, but v.l. text) samāpannaḥ = Tib. ḥoṅ ba daṅ
ḥgro bar ({%coming and going%}) gyur ba; LV 205.12 (lokasya,
{%people%})…ājavaṃjavasamāpannasyāsmāl lokāt paraṃ
lokaṃ paralokād imaṃ lokaṃ saṃdhāvataḥ saṃsarataḥ.
See next two items. The word contains double forms of
java or at least the root ju but its precise formation is
not clear to me; is ājava {%moving swiftly hither%}, and java
{%hastening away?%} For the preceding part of this cliché
see s.v. {@guṇāvaguṇṭhitabhūta@}; but the Pali correspon-
dent does not contain ājavaṃjava°, at least in most of
its occurrences.
