{@peyāla@}¦, prob. orig. m., see {@cakra-peyāla@}; also
seemingly nt.; regularly {@°laṃ@}, prob. acc. adverb, rarely
°lena, instr. (see also 2 {@piyāla@} and {@pe@}; = Pali peyyālaṃ;
presumably MIndic for Skt. paryāya, adverbial acc.), {%et%}
{%cetera%}, indicating abbreviation, usually but not always
of a passage previously cited in the text, and often but
not always with implication that the full text is supposed
to be recited: SP 174.6 (only in 2 mss.); LV 247.13 (iti
sarvaṃ °laṃ); 349.4; 418.7, 8, 9; Mvy 5435; Mv iii.219.10;
220.2; Śikṣ 6.2; 15.16; Bbh 19.8; 146.13; AsP 87.11;
Mmk 94.13; °laṃ vistareṇa kartavyaṃ Mmk 61.16; 107.10;
°laṃ yāvat Mv iii.202.11; 203.6; LV 150.15; 161.7; 248.4;
255.16; 397.14; pūrvavad eva peyālaṃ yāvad LV 417.22;
418.1 (but here and in lines 7, 8 read prob. peyālaḥ with
best mss.); (note in the same mg., without peyālam,
sarvaṃ pūrvavad yāvad LV 417.21; pūrvavad yāvad LV
403.19; 418.4, 5; sarvaṃ pūrvavat LV 409.3; yāvad,
alone, LV 403.20; sarvaṃ yāvad 418.3;) instr. peyālena,
noted only in evaṃ °lena kartavyam AsP 109.11; 159.9;
used where the passage has not occurred before in the
text in question, but where presumably its sense is re-
garded as well-known or obvious, like Eng. {%et cetera%}, SP
424.8, perhaps with connotation {%in short, in a word%}; so
in LV 295.21 (vs), the opening words of a series of stan-
zas, peyālam eṣa, {%this is the story in brief%}; similarly LV
314.21 (prose), beginning a résumé of a prec. series of
stanzas, peyālam, evaṃ, {%in brief, thus…%}; in Divy 103.1--2
(prose) read with mss. Triśaṅku-peyālaṃ, that is, {%Triśaṅku%}
{%etc%}. (the name that is understood with T. is not found
in Divy until 106.24 ff.).
