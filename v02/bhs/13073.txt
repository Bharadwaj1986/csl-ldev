{@lokāyatana@}¦ (nt.?), = Skt. lokāyata, the system so
named: °ne Divy 635.25; in BR cited from Colebrooke,
Essays 1.404 as personal, meaning {%a follower of the lokāyata%}
(the usual Skt. and BHS lokāyatika); it is cited from
Rāmatīrtha on Sadānanda; BR suggest that it is an error,
and indeed a note to the 2d ed., 1.428, states that lokāyatāḥ
is read in ‘the printed edition’.
