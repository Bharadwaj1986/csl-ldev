{@Gandhamādana, (1)@}¦ n. of a park in the city {@Ratana-@}
{@kholaka:@} Mv i.186.18; ({@2@}) n. of a pratyekabuddha: Mmk
40.22; 64.12 (here, acc. to Lalou Iconographie 35 n. 7,
taken by Tib. and Chin. as two names; she follows them,
but the interpretation is impossible in the other passages
and must certainly be rejected); 111.10; Av i.156.20 (here
a future pr. b.); ({@3@} = Skt. and Pali id., n. of a mountain,
which in Pali is persistently associated with pacceka-
buddhas, cf. 2 above: Mvy 4151; Mv ii.53.17; 55.4; Divy
