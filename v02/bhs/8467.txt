{@nirvṛta@}¦ (ppp. to Skt. nir-var-, but even in Skt. used
in ways which suggest secondary association with nir-vā-;
so in Skt. {%extinguished%}, of fire, also BHS, Mv i.66.1; Divy
157.12; Av i.48.8; and esp. often {%happy, blissful%}, in worldly
sense, also BHS, SP 106.13; Mv i.131.14), ({@1@}) like Pali
nibbuta functioning as ppp. to nirvāṇa and its relatives,
{%released, entered into nirvāṇa%} (oftener {@pari-nir°@}; see also
{@nirvṛtaka@} and {@nirvṛti@}): SP 392.9; 393.2, etc.; ({@2@}) in
Mv iii.214.6, 13 (vs) = Pali DN ii.242.18, 243.6, nirvṛta-
(Senart with mss. unmetr. °tā; Pali nīvuta-, text with
Cambodian sources, others nivuta-, ni- being unmetr.)-
brahmalokaṃ (adv.; Pali °lokā, n. sg. f. adj.); {%(in such%}
{%a way that the brahma-world is) cut off; shut out, excluded%}
{%(from the br. world)%}. So DN comm. ii.665.19 ff., nivuto
pihito (and later paṭicchanno) brahmaloko assā ti. This
implies Skt. nivṛta; the Pali nīvuta, adopted by ed.,
must have ī m.c.; Mv nirvṛta also, directly or indirectly,
m.c., perhaps directly derived from a misunderstood
MIndic nīvuta with false Sktization.
