{@saṃdṛśyati@}¦, {%sees%}: Gv 523.20--21 yathā māyākāro…
sarvarūpagatāni sarvakriyāś ca saṃdṛśyati (by his magic
power). Seems to be a nonce-formation analogical to
saṃdṛśyante, regular passive, {%they are seen%}, which occurs
three times in the text just before (lines 16, 18, 20); the
meaning is confirmed by the following conclusion of the
simile: evam eva sudhanaḥ…tāni sarvavyūhavikurvi-
tāny adrākṣīt. To the pass. saṃdṛśyate, {%is seen%}, was formed
an active saṃdṛśyati, {%sees%}. The same seems true once of
{@dṛśyati@}, q.v.
