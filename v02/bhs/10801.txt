{@phalaka, (1)@}¦ m., °kaḥ Mvy 9192 = Tib. sgrog guḥi
rten ma, {%holder for a strap%}; perhaps a {%fastener%}, something
like a {%button%}, to be affixed to a monk's robe, and to which
a {%strap%} is fastened; I believe phalaka has this mg. in Pali
gaṇṭhika-pha° pāsaka-pha° Vin. ii.136.38; 137.1, 3 (not a
kind of cloth, perhaps made of leaves, as assumed SBE
17.246); so Chin. on Mvy, {%leather bag or pocket with button(s)%};
({@2@}) nt., in ŚsP 1430.9, cited approximately in Śikṣ 210.5 as:
gāṃ hatvā tīkṣṇena śastreṇa catvāri phalakāni kṛtvā, acc.
to Bendall and Rouse {%four quarters%} (of the animal), which
seems implausible; possibly four {%leather bags%} (of the hide)?
cf. Chin. cited above; or {%belts?%} (this mg. given for AMg.
phalaga in Ratnach.); ({@3@}) nt., {%grain%} (of sand): vālikā-
phalakāni Gv 134.20 f.; ({@4@}) see s.v. {@Halaka; (5)@} see also
{@phalaha@}. (In Divy 316.26 phalaka may mean {%bark%}, as
in Skt., used as material for garments.)
