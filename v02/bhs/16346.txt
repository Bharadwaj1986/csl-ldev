{@saṃmiñjayati@}¦ (= Pali °jeti, also written samiñjeṭi;
connected with {@un-minj-, ni-miñj-@}, and prec. and next;
in mss. and edd. also written samiñj-, but incorrectly,
see below), {%bends back, draws in, contracts%}, parts of the
body, esp. the arms; always assoc. with its opposite
prasārayati (Skt.), {%extends%}: saṃmiñjitaṃ (vā) bāhuṃ (in
Mv oftener °tāṃ…bāhāṃ) prasāraye(t, once °yeya)
prasāritaṃ (vā, or ca) bāhuṃ (the noun may be omitted;
Mv oftener °tāṃ…bāhāṃ) saṃmiñjaye(t) Mv i.55.1, 14;
56.8; iii.425.15, 22; 450.16; Mmk 3.26; Divy 473.6; Wald-
schmidt, Kl. Skt. Texte 4, 65.20 (Śakrapraśnasūtra, acc.

prasāraye Mv iii.422.(16--)17 (so Senart, em., but prob.
rightly), in a description of a bhikṣu, {%whenever he draws%}
{%in or extends%} (any member of) {%his body%}. Leumann, Album
Kern 393 f., adopts an earlier suggestion of Kern's and
derives from sam-vṛj-. He rightly distinguishes this verb
from Pali sam-iñjati (Dhp. 81, na samiñjanti paṇḍitā),
{%is moved, is perturbed%}; cf. BHS {@iñjate@}. But when Leumann
states that this sam-iñjati, in its Pali mg., is also found
in BHS, I fear that he was speaking carelessly. The only
cases of sam-iñj- which I have noted are shown by associa-
tion with forms of prasār- to be false readings for saṃmiñj-;
such cases also occur in Pali (PTSD). The only ‘confusion’
shown by BHS in this sept consists in the erroneous
writing of samiñj- for saṃmiñj- (which Leumann also
recognizes). Leumann's etym. seems to me at least more
plausible than any other, including that of Lüders (s.v.
{@samarjana@}). That double mm (or ṃm), not single m,
is the only correct form is proved by un-miñj- and ni-
miñj-, neither of which occurs in Pali; Leumann considers
them (as he must according to his etymology) secondarily
abstracted from saṃ-miñj-. I have found no trace of the
sept elsewhere.
