only once, ppp. °buddhaḥ, with atra, {%well skilled, learned,%}
{%enlightened%} on this matter, Mbh. Crit. ed. 3.178.27; the
pres. °bodhati implied in ger. °bodhitvā), ({@1@}) {%becomes%}
{%enlightened, attains complete enlightenment%} (i.e. becomes a
Buddha); the common meaning in BHS. Used absolutely:

anuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhim, {%unto supreme perfect en-%}
{%lightenment%}, the subject being a Buddha or other person:

ppp. in passive sense see below;) ger. °buddhitvā (anutta-
rāṃ samvak°) Mv iii.111.17; 272.18; 349.6; °bodhitvā Mv
i.312.18; ii.348.15 (here v.l. °buddhitvā); inf. °boddhu-
kāmena Samādh 8.1; instead of acc., loc. of same comple-
ment, opt. °buddheyaṃ (anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau)
LV 38.18, and ppp. °buddhaḥ Mvy 6355; the pres. °budhy-
ate, the ppp., and the gdve., are also used passively,
subject being anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhiḥ, and the person
put in the instr.: Vaj 37.8--9 (tathāgatena…) an°rā
samy°dhir abhisaṃbuddhā, {%supreme enlightenment was%}
{%attained, realized%}; so also SP 218.11--12; LV 377.2; Divy
393.9; pres. °budhyate Vaj 41.19; gdve. °boddhavyā Kv
18.18; note also the cpd. abhisaṃbuddha-bodhis (tathā-
gataḥ) LV 377.1, {%the T. having attained enlightenment%};
({@2@}) the verb is however also used (as in the isolated Skt.
occurrence noted above) in the sense of {%learns thoroughly,%}
{%becomes skilled in, comprehends perfectly%}: SP 210.3--4
asmābhir…tathāgatajñāne abhisaṃboddhavye (loc.
abs.), {%when the T. knowledge ought to have been realized%}
(thoroughly learned) {%by us%}; Ud xviii.18 (kāyaṃ) marīcidhar-
maṃ °budhānaḥ (so oldest ms., with Pali Dhp. 46; later
mss. paribudhya caiva, see {@paribudhyati@}), {%learning to%}
{%know%} (realizing) {%the body as having the nature of a mirage%};
LV 263.21 nāsau mārgaḥ śakya evaṃ…°boddhum, {%that%}
{%Way cannot be realized%} (made the object of enlightened
understanding) {%in this manner%}; Bhīk 22b.5 kaccid evaṃ-
rūpaṃ sthānam abhisaṃbhotsyase? abhisaṃbhotsye, {%you%}
{%will learn perfectly such-and-such a point%} (of duty), {%won't%}
{%you? I will%}; ({@3@}) when the subject is dharma, and perhaps
in some other cases, it may not be clear whether the verb
means {%understands%} or {%illumines, makes clear%}; in Mv iii.314.1
dharmaḥ abhisaṃbuddho (said by the Buddha shortly
after his enlightenment) probably means {%the Law that I have%}
{%perfectly comprehended%}, but possibly {%made clear%} (to myself);
in Mv iii.331.10, 14 tathāgatenāryasmiṃ dharmavinaye
madhyamā pratipadā abhisaṃbuddhā, apparently {%the%}
{%middle course of conduct, perfectly illumined%} (made clear)
{%by the T. in the noble dharma%} (i.e. sūtras) {%and vinaya%}; Vaj
32.13 yas tathāgatena dharmo 'bhisaṃbuddho deśito
nidhyāto; Vaj 37.11--12 yaś ca…tathāgatena dharmo
'bhisambuddho deśto vā, {%realized (? made clear) or taught%};
and ({@4@}) we even find, in a few curious passages in Vaj,
the complement anuttarāṃ (or °rā) samyaksaṃbodhim
(or °dhir), as in (1) above, with dharmaḥ…abhisaṃ-
buddhaḥ; the precise meaning is not too clear: Vaj 36.8--9
asti sa kaścid dharmo yas tathāgatena dīpaṃkarasya…
antikād anuttarāṃ samy° °bodhim abhisaṃbuddhaḥ
(repeated below), {%is there any principle which has been%}
{%realized (comprehended? made clear?), unto supreme perfect%}
{%enlightenment, by the T%}. (taking it) {%from D.?%} (the transl.
in SBE 49 pt. 2, p. 132 is very loose); Vaj 37.10--11 nāsti…
dharmo yas tathāgatenānuttarāṃ samy° °bodhim °bud-
dhaḥ: and with nom. of complement, Vaj 24.2--3 asti sa kaś-
cid dharmo yas tathāgatenānuttarā samy° °bodhir ity abhi-
saṃbuddhaḥ,…{%any principle which was realized as (?)…%}
(SBE 49 pt. 2, p. 118 {%known under the name of%}); perhaps
the nom. of the complement (apparently isolated) is a
corruption for the acc., used at least twice in such a phrase.
