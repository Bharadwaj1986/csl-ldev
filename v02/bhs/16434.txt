{@sarvatratāye@}¦, adv. (app. instr. of *sarvatra-tā;
= Pali sabbattatāya or sabbatthatāya, see below), {%alto-%}
{%gether, in every way%}: sarvehi (q.v.) °tāye sarvāvantaṃ
lokaṃ spharitvopasaṃpadya viharati Mv iii.213.14, in a
passage found repeatedly in Pali (PTSD s.v. sabbatthatā),
e.g. DN i.251.2, analyzed Vism. 308.4 ff., where (as in
DN and elsewhere) sabbattatāya is read; this is analyzed
308.29 as sabb-atta-(= ātma-)tāya: sabbadhi °tāya
sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ…pharitvā viharati; some texts
read sabbatthatāya (as if based on sabbattha = sarvatra);
there is no record in Pali Dictt. of any other occurrence
of the word (on Kaccāyana-vutti's sabbathattā see CPD
s.v. a-sabb° with ref.); but the BHS word occurs also in:
śarvaśo °tāye jñātavyaṃ Mv i.229.9 = ii.133.10 = 285.2;
(ye kecid) bhavā (mss. bhave) sarve hi (read {@sarvehi@},
q.v.?) °tāye saṃvartanti (prob. delete punctuation and
add with mss. ye), sarve te bhavā anityā…ii.418.12.
