{@āpīḍaka@}¦ (= Skt. āpīḍa, {%chaplet, wreath%}), only in
°ka-jāta {%hung with wreaths%}, noted only as ep. of trees:
°ka-jātam Mvy 6061 (context suggests that it was prob.
epithet of a tree, or at least referred to trees); °ka-jātān
(vṛkṣān) Divy 215.25, 27; 216.1; °ka-jātāḥ (phalavṛkṣāḥ)
Divy 221.14 (so certainly read as suggested in note; text
with mss. āpīnaka-).
