{@saṃyojana@}¦, nt., once (Gv 387.3) {@°nā@} (= Pali °na,
or saññojana, Pugg. 22.11 ff.), {%fetter%}, as binding to existence,
to misery: parikṣīṇa-bhava-°na ity ucyate (Buddha) LV
425.21; without listing or number, °naiḥ Ud iii.6; (sg.)
iv.29; xv.6 (pl. ?); xx.1; sāvaśeṣa-°na (kālaṃ kṛ-) Divy
302.21; 553.24; 555.27--8, {%(to die) while having%} (some)
{%fetters remaining%}; °nam Mvy 2134, foll. by bandhana,
anuśaya, paryutthāna, upakleśa, paryupasthāna (read
with var. paryavasth°); cf. °na-bandhanānuśayopakleśa-
paryavasthānānāṃ Bbh 202.20; na °nayā ({%by any fetter%})
bandhanānuśayaparyavasthāna-vaśagatāḥ Gv 387.3; there
are 10, as in Pali (see PTSD, order slightly diff.), listed
AbhidhK. LaV-P. v.84 and 87, in two groups (also in
Pali), called {@avarabhāgīya@}, q.v. (viz. satkāyadṛṣṭi, śīlavra-
taparāmarśa, vicikitsā, kāmacchanda, vyāpāda), and {@ūr-@}
{@dhvabhāgīya@}, q.v. (viz. rūparāga, ārūpyarāga, auddhatya,
māna, avidyā); the first three are also specially listed as
three saṃyojana, e.g. Laṅk 117.14 (with vicikitsā as No. 2
and śīlavrata° as 3, as in Pali), for reasons explained
AbhidhK. op. cit. 85--87; they are prob. meant by trīṇi
°nāṃ (tyaktvā) Mv i.192.7 (vs); trayāṇāṃ °nānāṃ MSV
ii.86.11; Divy 534.3; but Divy 533.28 may intend to name
[Page539-a+ 71]
rāga, dveṣa, and moha as 3 saṃyojana (but there is prob.
a lacuna in text, read as in MSV ii.87.1--2); Divy 533.24--25
also speaks of pañcānām avarabhāgīyānām °nānāṃ pra-
hāṇād, without listing them; same MSV ii.87.7; further,
Divy 95.22 knows nine saṃy° (see s.v. {@visaṃyojanaka@}),
which no doubt refers to the nine listed AbhidhK. LaV-P.
v.81 f. (shortly before the place cited above), viz. anunaya,
pratigha, māna, avidyā, dṛṣṭi, parāmarśa, vicikitsā, īrṣyā,
mātsarya; cf. īrṣyā-mātsarya-°na-saṃprayuktā devamanu-
ṣyā Mv i.350.8.
