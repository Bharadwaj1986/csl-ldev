{@Maitreya, (1)@}¦ also {@Maitriya@} m.c., and {@Maitraka,@}
{@Maitra-nātha, °nāman@}, and perh. {@Maitrīya@}, qq.v.; =
Pali Metteyya), n. of the next Buddha to follow Śākya-
muni, predicted by him; has special ep. {@Ajita@}, q.v.: SP
3.9; 7.4 ff.; 302.11, 16; 307.11; 308.1; 309.1; 310.13;
311.1; 312.13; 315.5; 316.12; 327.2; 329.11; 332.5; 345.1 ff.;
478.11; Mv i.59.2 (etc., see Senart's Index); iii.240.11 ff.;
243.19; 246.16; 247.15; 330.8; LV 2.10 (first of a list of
Bodhisattvas); 39.2 ff.; 422.7, 11; 443.7; 444.12; Mvy 646
(= Tib. byams pa, second in a list, after Avalokiteśvara);
Divy 60.25 ff. (prediction of his history); 326.10 (in an
earlier existence gave his life for a tigress); Av ii.176.3;
Suv 117.5 (M°-prabhṛtīnāṃ bodhisattvānāṃ); 157.19;
239.6 (here Maitriyo, m.c.; v.l. Maitrayo); Śikṣ 15.13 etc.;
Dharmas 12 (first of 8 Bodhisattvas); Sukh 2.13 (M°-pūr-
vaṃgamaiś ca saṃbahulair bodhisattvair); Karmav 71.22;
Mmk 40.14; 62.16, etc.; Sādh 20.8 etc.; as the first in a
long list of future Buddhas Gv 441.23; as the first of a
much shorter list, not over ten, Mv ii.354.17 = iii.279.1,
most of the names being found at the beginning of the
Gv list, which is evidently an enormous expansion of an
old traditional list; even the order is nearly the same;
Maitreya is succeeded by {@Siṃha@}, then {@Pradyota, Ketu@}
(these two are interchanged in the Mv order), {@Sunetra@}
[Page440-b+ 71]
(in Mv preceded by {@Jyotiṃdhara@} or {@Jyotīvara@}, or the
like, which Gv lacks), {@Kusuma@} and {@Kusumaśrī@} (in Mv
these two are represented by ‘two Kusumas’), {@Tiṣya@} (so
Gv, prob. unorig.; T. regularly precedes P. in lists of {%past%}
Buddhas; Mv has instead {@Meru@} or {@Maru@}), {@Puṣya@} (Mv
{@Puṣpa@}); here the Mv list ends. In Mv iii.279.19--20 there
follows a reference to the four Buddhas of ‘this bhadra-
kalpa’, still put in the future; these two lines seem to be
a secondary addition of Mv iii.279, being not found in
the parallel ii.355; because of them Senart, iii Introd.
XXVI note 1, attributes the whole list to the past, which
is scarcely conceivable with a list headed by Maitreya,
and is disproved by the Gv parallel; in Gv 456.19 intro-
ductory to long chapter on M°, Gv 466.15 ff., special
glorification of him; ({@2@}) n. of a brahmanical gotra (sg. as
n. of various persons in Skt.): pl. Divy 635.12.
