{@? a-bhūmi@}¦, adj. (or read or understand a-bhūmyam,
neg. of {@bhūmya@}, q.v.?), {%non-terrestrial%}, i.e. {%celestial,%}
{%supernal%}: Mv i.72.9 (vs) vartayiṣyi varacakram abhūmi,
{%I shall start turning the celestial excellent wheel%} (of the
Law). So one ms.; the rest abhūṣi (which makes no sense);
Senart em. adbhutaṃ, which is violent, and metrically
impossible. PTSD alleges a Pali abhumma, {%groundless,%}
{%unfounded, unsubstantial%}, Jāt v.178.11; vi.495.23; but
CPD rejects this word and reads abhuṃ me in both
passages.
