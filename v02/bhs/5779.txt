{@guṇāvaguṇṭhita-bhūta@}¦, adj. (see below for Pali),
LV 205.11, {%entangled in%} (or {%like; a maze or tangle of%}) {%cords%}
{%(threads)%}. Corresp. to Mvy 5391 {@guḍā-guñjika-bhūta@},
q.v., = Tib. dru gu ({%ball%} or {%skein of thread%}) ḥdziṅs pa
({%implicatus, embrouillé%}, Dict. Fr. Cath. Miss.) lta bu,
{%become as it were mixed up in a skein of thread%}. Parts of
this old cliché in Mvy 5390--93 and in LV l.c., and re-
peatedly in Pali, see PTSD s.v. guḷā, which misinterprets;
an approximation to the Tib. transl. of this word (with
jāta for bhuta) is given in Pali comms., e.g. DN comm.
ii.495.24 ff. LV: aho vatāhaṃ…lokasya tantrākulajā-
tasya (q.v.; so mss.) guṇāvaguṇṭhitabhūtasyā- (here Mvy
adds {@muñja-balbajajāta@}, q.v., with Pali) -javaṃjava-
samāpannasyāsamāt etc. (for the rest see s.v. {@ājavaṃ-@}
{@java@}; Pali lacks this part, at least in most occurrences).
The tradition, both Pali and BHS, is confused on the
form of this word, but there seems no doubt of the es-
sential meaning, as stated above. Instead of guṇa, {%thread%},
Mvy has guḍā, {%ball%} (sc. {%of thread%}; both Tib. dru gu and
Pali comms. prove this mg., against PTSD). In Pali the
mss. in different occurrences show guḷā, guḷi, guṇa, kulā,
[Page213-a+ 71]
kula, etc.; I suspect the orig. may have been guḍā (Pali
guḷā), as in Mvy, but note the Pali v.l. guṇa as in LV;
the mg. of the two is practically identical here. The
second member appears in Pali as guṇṭhita, guṇṭhika,
guṇḍika, guṇika, gaṇṭhita, gandhika, etc.; in LV ava-
guṇṭhita, in Mvy guñjika which seems to be unparalleled
and uninterpretable. The orig. was most likely guṇṭhita;
but possibly guṇṭhika (Pali, prob. based on a MIndic
guṇṭhiya, really = guṇṭhita), or guṇḍita (AMg. guṇḍia,
°ya).
