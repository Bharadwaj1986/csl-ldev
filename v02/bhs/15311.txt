1 {@śreṇika@}¦, adj. (cf. {@a-śreṇika@}), a (relatively) compli-
mentary epithet of a wandering mendicant, always with
parivrājakaḥ: ŚsP 615.12; 633.13; AsP 8.21; 9.10. But
apparently not a Buddhist; his knowledge is ‘limited’,
{@prādeśika@}, ŚsP 615.13, tho superior to that of the aśreṇika.
Cf. Rahder, JAOS 70.126. One might guess that śreṇika
meant ‘members of a guild or (non-Buddhist) order of
monks’; but śreṇi is not a normal expression for a religious
order. In AMg. seḍhi (= Skt. śreṇi) is used of a certain
stage of religious advancement among the Jains, and
a-seḍhi-gaya (= Skt. *a-śreṇi-gata) means one who has
not yet attained that stage; see Ratnach. s.vv. Could
aśreṇika equal AMg. aseḍhigaya, and śreṇika, its opposite,
one who has attained that stage ? Two Jain terms used,
and applied to Jain or other heterodox monks? This is
only a guess, and prob. not likely.
