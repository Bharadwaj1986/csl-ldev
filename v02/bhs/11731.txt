{@mahā-nagna@}¦, m. (cpd. of mahā and {@nagna@}, q.v.;
seems to correspond to Pali mahānāga, DN i.51.10 °gā,
n. pl., in a list of kinds of fighting men which includes
uggā rājaputtā…sūrā cammayodhino etc.; comm. i.157.6
mahānāgā viya mahānāgā; hatthiādisu pi abhimukham
āgacchantesu anivattitayodhānaṃ etaṃ adhivacanaṃ, all
of which only proves that the comm. did not understand
the term; it is omitted in PTSD, altho Childers properly
refers to Burnouf, Lotus, 452, n. 4, who in translating the
Pali suggests equivalence to BHS mahānagna, which he
takes to be the older form; Skt. nagna would give MIndic
nagga, for which nāga might be substituted; Burnouf also
compares the Skt. n. pr. Nagnajit, perh. {%conquering cham-%}
{%pions%}; pw and Speyer, Av Index, render {%athlete%}, but this
is only an attempt to explain the word etymologically;
it is implausible in several passages, and opposed by Tib.),
{%great man, champion%} (orig. in warfare); {%man of distinction,%}
{%dignitary, grandee, nobleman%}; regularly (in Mvy and LV)
rendered by Tib. tshan po (Jä. {%dignitary, grandee%}) che
({%great%}): (tasya dvau) °gnau saṃśritau Divy 372.12; tasyāpi
°gno Bhadrāyudho nāmnānekasahasraparivāraḥ (can
hardly mean {%athlete!%}), sa bhagavacchāsane pravrajito
'rhan saṃvṛttaḥ 373.20; krodhāviṣṭasya °gnasya Gv

nāpi saṃdhārayituṃ 509.4; °gnā(ḥ) Kv 41.21 (printed
mahāmagnā); Av ii.102.15; often in comp. with bala (the
might of a mahānagna being evidently proverbial): °gna-
balam Mvy 8210; °gna-balopetāni LV 200.21 (prose);
sarve °gna-balair upetā LV 28.5 (vs); others, cpd. with
bala, MSV i.100.10; Av ii.108.12; 110.3; with -balin, Av
i.376.1, 4, 18; without -bala, duṣṭamalla-mahanagna-samā
