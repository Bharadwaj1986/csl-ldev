{@pātayantika@}¦, adj., and {@°kā@}, subst. (for alternative
Pali and BHS forms see below), {%causing fall%} (to an evil
existence, if not repented and expiated); this is clearly
the usual Northern interpretation; one of the three main
kinds of monkish transgressions, the others being {@pārājika@}
and {@saṃghāvaśeṣa@}, qq.v.: as adj., °ka with dharma,
(trayāṇāṃ dharmāṇām anyatamānyatamena dharmeṇa
vadet pārājikena vā saṃghāvaśeṣeṇa vā) pātayantikena
vā Prāt 489.(1--)3, and ff.; there are 30 offenses called
{@niḥsargikāḥ@} (q.v.) pātayantikā dharmāḥ 490.8, listed in
the following where each is called °gikā °yantikā (subst.
fem.), 490.11--12 and ff.; they are followed by 90 pā-
tayantikā dharmāḥ 502.13, each again styled pātayantikā
(subst. fem.) 502.15 ff.; °tikā dharmāḥ also Mvy 8417 =
Tib. ltuṅ byed, lit. {%making fall%}, usually rendered {%trans-%}
{%gression%}; the Pali correspondents are 30 nissaggiyā pā-
cittiyā dhammā Vin. iii.195.1, each one styled nissaggiyaṃ
pācittiyaṃ (nt., not f.) id. 18, etc., followed by 92 pā-
cittiyā dhammā, Vin. iv.1, each one styled pācittiyaṃ
2.14 ff. On the various forms of Pali and BHS see (besides
older treatments, now obsolete) S. Lévi, JA. Nov.--Dec.
1912, 506--8, and esp. Waldschmidt, Kl. Skt. Texte 3.116 f.,
who says inter alia: In den späteren Turfanfragmenten
erscheint ganz allgemein als Sanskritform pātayantikā’
(so e.g. op. cit. 41.1). He notes that pāteti is used in Pali
in explaining pācittiya, Vin. v.148.30, and that pātayati
is similarly used in BHS in explaining the mg. of other
(substitute) forms, see below. He states that Chin., like
Tib. (regularly ltuṅ byed, above), supports this mg. On
the other hand he reports a BHS ms. reading pāca(tt)i,
which reminds one of the Pali form; and shows that
pātayantika, and other alternative forms, are rendered
in ways which suggest association (certainly unhistorical)
with root pac-; he cites a passage (p. 117) reading pā-
tayantikā, pacati dahati uddahati avyutthitasyāvaraṇa-
kṛtyaṃ karoti, tenāha pātayantikā, and compares Divy
544.10 pāyantiketi (text pāpānti°, as also 543.24; in 544.15
mss. pāyantikām, read thus all three times with Lévi
l.c. above) dahati pacati pātayati (so with Lévi for text
yāt°). Besides the popular etymology pāpāntikā of the
Divy mss., just cited, Das gives pāpātmikā for Tib. ltuṅ
byed. The same word is read pāyattikāḥ (sc. dharmāḥ)
[Page340-b+ 71]
Mvy 8360; (naiḥsargikāḥ, q.v., = niḥsa°) pāyattikāḥ 8383,
and pāpattikā (f.) 9223, but with vv.ll. in one or more
of these places (besides pāyattikā in the last) pāyantika
(pāyantikām āpattim, acc., MSV ii.174.9), pāpantika,
pāṭāyantika, pātavantika, (acc. to Waldschmidt also
pādayantika,) and with °kā as subst. f. (pāyantikayā,
instr., MSV iii.109.20). There is moreover (besides pācatti
cited by Waldschmidt above) prāyaścittikāḥ (sc. dharmāḥ)
Mvy 8418 (śuddha-p°, acc. to Tib. {%only, merely prāy°%},
ḥbaḥ zhig tu ḥgyur ba); (snāna-)prāyaścittikaṃ 8484
(both these = Tib. ltuṅ byed); and prāyaścittikaḥ (sc.
dharmaḥ) Mvy 9307 (= Tib. ltuṅ ba, {%fall%}), which is fol-
lowed by śuddha- (Tib. ma ḥdres pa, {%unmixed%}) -pāpattikaḥ
(sc. dharmaḥ; Tib. again ltuṅ ba, = prec.) 9308, cf. 8418
above, and s.v. {@śuddhaka@}. Lévi l.c. points out the phonetic
difficulty of deriving Pali pācittiya from BHS prāyaścit-
tika, and proposes an orig. *prākcitta plus -ika, thru
*paccittika to pāci°, {%la pensée en avant%}, = either (des
actes commis) {%avec précipitation%}, or {%qui précipitent%} (aux
enfers). He cites a Tocharian loan pāyti, which he says
goes back to pāyantika. It is obvious that the orig. form
and mg. of the word can not be confidently reconstructed.
