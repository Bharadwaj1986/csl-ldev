{@an-ābhoga@}¦ (see {@ābhoga@} and {@sābhoga@}), ({@1@}) adj.,
{%effortless%}: crucial is Dbh 67.10 ff., where a boat, before it
reaches the open sea, is sābhoga-vāhana, {%traveling with%}
(human) {%effort%}; when it reaches the open sea it is anābho-
gavāhano vātamaṇḍalīpraṇīto, {%traveling without effort, borne%}
{%along by a tornado%}, and goes in a single day farther than it
could go in a hundred years by all effortful traveling
(sarvasābhogavāhanatayā, i.e. by rowing etc.). So, by
the knowledge of the Omniscient (sarvajñajñānena),
because this knowledge is {%effortless%} (automatic, spontane-
ous: jñānānābhogatayā), a Bodhisattva gets in a single
moment farther than he could get in 100,000 kalpas by
his former effortful activity (pūrvakeṇa sābhogakarmaṇā).
Again, in Sūtrālaṃkāra ix. 18--19, a Buddha's activities
proceed without ābhoga, {%effortlessly, spontaneously%}, like
music from instruments that are not being played, or
jewels that shine without labor. So understand anābhoga-

{%created; not contrived by human labor%}, Jäschke) {%Buddha-%}

involving or subject to any effort), anābhogaprekṣikayā
{%with impassive look%} Śikṣ 268.1; (see s.v. {@ābhoga@} for Dbh
64.16;) prob. {%impassive%} in Bbh 317.3, and 350.12 bodhi-

trasted with (and higher than) their {@sābhoga@} ({%effortful%})
