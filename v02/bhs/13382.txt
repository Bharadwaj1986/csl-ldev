<L>13382<pc>472,2<k1>वल<k2>वल
[{@vala@}¦, so Lefm with most mss., and Calc. bala, in
LV 429.22 (prose)-nagnavalānupradāna-, which certainly
must mean {%giving clothes to the naked%}. Neither bala nor
vala nor even vara is recorded in any such mg. as {%garment%}
or {%cloth%}. Two mss. are reported as reading vaila, which
obviously intends caila; so read with Foucaux (Notes 206).]
