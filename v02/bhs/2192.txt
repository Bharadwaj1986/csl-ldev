Index {%discouragement%}, not quite rightly; the opposite is
utsahanā-vineya, see {@utsahanā@}); in LV 70.11 (saṃcārya)
vicāryāvasādanākāreṇa pāṇiṃ saṃcārayati sma (subject,
the Bodhisattva in his mother's womb); Foucaux, ‘en
l'étendant pour le signal du départ’ (sc. for the attendant
gods), but avasādanā can hardly mean this. Tib. had a
quite different reading, containing smṛtaḥ saṃprajānan
as in 1.15 (dran zhiṅ śes bzhin du, both times). I cannot
solve the passage but think it probably corrupt, despite
the lack of variants. Perhaps follow the lead of Tib.
