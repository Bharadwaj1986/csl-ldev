{@? avarṇa@}¦, adj., in Mv iii.343.1 °ṇaś ca, epithet of the
Buddha's voice (svara); hence must be complimentary;
but Skt. id. and Pali avaṇṇa are normally uncomplimen-
tary. Senart has no v.l. or note and does not list the word
in his Index. Perhaps semi-MIndic for Skt. avarṇya (or
read this?), {%indescribable%}; cf. Pali avaṇṇanīya.
