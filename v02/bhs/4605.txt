{@kalpika-śālā@}¦, also {@°ka-sthāna@}, corresp. to Pali
kappiya-kuṭī (also -bhūmi), which is variously rendered
(in SBE 13.304, on Vin. i.139.36, {%kitchen%}), in MSV i.235.2.
[Page173-b+ 71]
4 (°śālā), 8 ff. (°sthāna), introduced as a place where
broth for a sick monk could be heated, and seems to
mean lit. either {%hall (place) for allowable (proper) perqui-%}
{%sites%} (see prec.), or possibly {%hall (place) for preparation%} of
such perquisites (?); five are listed (cf. the somewhat
diff. list of four in Pali Vin. i.240.1 ff.), ārabhyamāṇāntikā
(sc. śālā; {%whose boundaries%}, anta, {%are being proposed%}),
ucchrīyamāṇāntikā, {@goniṣādikā, udbhūtavastukā, saṃ-@}
{@matikā@}; all are ‘explained’ in 6 ff., but the glosses are
not all very clear. In i.234.4 kalpika-sthāna refers to a
proper place for preparing (perhaps also storing? see
{@pratijāgarti@}) food, and ten akalpikāni (sthānāni) are
listed 5 ff.
