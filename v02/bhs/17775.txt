{@heluka@}¦ (m. or nt.), a high number: Gv 106.3; prob.
a doublet for the next, for which the same line also has
{@loka@} (read {@aloka@} or {@āl°@}), before this, and separated from
it only by {@indriya@} which no other list contains; this, like
{@heluga@} in Mvy 7741, is followed by {@durbuda@} (Mvy dra-
buddha), and then by {@haruṇa@} (in both alike).
