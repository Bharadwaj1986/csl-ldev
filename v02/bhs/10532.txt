{@? praviśāmayati@}¦, perhaps {%stills, causes to subside%}:
smṛtim upasthāpayati (q.v. 2) praviśāmayati Divy 542.22;
seems to be opposite (or, perhaps, equivalent?) of upasthāp°,
but I do not understand the passage; Index leaves praviś°
untranslated; context seems to throw no light on it. Cf.
{@pratiśāmayati@}, which however does not seem to fit in
this place.
