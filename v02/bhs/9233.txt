{@parīttābha@}¦ (= Pali paritt°), m. pl., {%of limited radiance%},
one (usually the 1st) of the classes of {@rūpāvacara@} gods of
the 2d dhyānabhūmi; usually with {@deva@}, q.v.: LV 150.6;
Mv ii.348.19; Mvy 3090; Dharmas 128; Divy 68.14 and
367.12 (mss. in both parītā°); Mmk 43.21; Gv 249.14;
Av i.5.2, etc. Once, in Mv ii.163.17, seems to be used
otherwise, as adj., but the expression is very strange,
possibly corrupt; at the time of the Bodhisattva's abhiniṣ-
kramaṇa, the habitations of various gods became com-
pletely purified; at the end of the list, in 16, śuddhāvāsā-
nāṃ (highest of rūpāvacara gods, and far higher than
parīttābha gods) devānāṃ bhavanāni (etc.); then, in 17,
evaṃ ca teṣu śuddhāvāseṣu deveṣu parīttābhānāṃ samyak-
saṃbuddhānāṃ adhiṣṭhitāni caṅkramā niṣadyāni śayyāni
tāni pi atīva pariśuddhāni abhūnsuḥ paryavadātā. I
cannot explain the dwelling of Perfectly Enlightened
Buddhas ‘of limited radiance’ among śuddhāvāsa gods.
