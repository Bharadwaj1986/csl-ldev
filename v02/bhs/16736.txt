{@sārāyaṇīya@}¦ (on etym. see below), ({@1@}) nt., {%hospitable%}
{%entertainment%}, esp. with food: °yaṃ karetsu (so mss.,
prec. by na) saṃbuddhasya punaḥ-punaḥ Mv i.304.5 (vs),
(the villagers) {%gave entertainment to the Perfectly Enlightened%}
{%One again and again%} (sc. with food, which they had pre-
viously refused him); ṛṣiṇā tasya lubdhakasya °ṇīyaṃ
kṛtaṃ, yathā ṛṣidharmo phalodakam upanāmitaṃ Mv
ii.96.17; ({@2@}) adj., f. °yā (= {@saṃrañjana, °nīya, saṃraja-@}
{@nīya@}; = Pali sārāṇīya, which Childers derives from the
Skt. root smṛ, following standard Pali comms., e.g. MN
comm. i.110.16 ff., ii.394.31 f., but this is certainly wrong;
Kern, cited PTSD, rightly regards BHS saṃrañjana,
°nīya, as the true original; all forms can be derived from
this; saṃ- gave sā-, and for -rañja- was substituted first
*-rāja-, both by § 3.3, then -rāya-, as in BHS, § 2.34;
finally in Pali this -rāya- was contracted to the single
syllable -rā-, Pischel 149, 150, cf. § 3.118, Geiger 20; the
rare BHS saṃrajanīya, if not an error for saṃrañj°, may
be derived from the unnasalized form of the same root
raj), {%courteous, pleasing, polite, friendly%}: this form noted
only in Mv iii.47.18 etc. (cited, with list of passages, s.v.
{@saṃmodate@}; always °yāṃ kathām); in iii.394.14, however,
mss. sāropaṇīyāṃ instead (Senart em.), and one of them
also reads sāropayitvā for the following vyatisārayitvā.
