{@utkaṇṭhati@}¦, and ppp. utkaṇṭhita (cf. next; in Skt.
only {%longs for; longing%}; but Pali ukkaṇṭhati also {%is annoyed%},
°ṭhita {%annoyed%}), {%is annoyed; annoyed%}; the ppp. in Mv
ii.272.7 rājā śrutvā utkaṇṭhito evaṃ jāto, {%the king, hearing%}
(this), {%became annoyed, as follows%} (here certainly not
{%desirous!%}); similarly ii.274.11 so utkaṇṭhito (context
makes {%desirous%} impossible). In Bbh 193.6 (tair bodhi-
sattvaḥ lūhaiḥ stokair asatkṛtya dhandhaṃ) ca labdhair
notkaṇṭhyate na paritasyati, prob. {%is not made annoyed%}
(pass. of caus.). There may be other cases; many are
ambiguous.
