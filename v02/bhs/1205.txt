{@anyamanya@}¦, adj. or pron. (= Pali aññamañña, in
both mgs.; cf. {@anyonya@}), ({@1@}) {%one another%}; as pron., adj.,
or adv. (°nyaṃ) or in comp., {%mutual, reciprocal%} (= an-
yonya): SP 209.5 (vs) paraṃparā eva tathānyamanyaṃ te
vyākariṣyanti; 359.2 (vs) ye cānyamanyasya karonti
ghoṣān; LV 176.9 (vs) anyamanyopacayena, {%by mutual%}
{%assistance%}; Suv 16.12 (vs) anyamanyānukūlena; RP 38.11
(vs). In prose of most texts replaced by anyonya; but
Mv has it often in prose. Note anyonya SP 163.11, 12;
LV 51.16; 410.19, 20; while in the same passage (prose)
anyamanya is used in Mv i.41.8 = 230.3 = iii.334.11 =
341.15 (but in i.240.13 anyonya). Inflected like anyonya
in Skt.: °nyaṃ, acc., Mv i.10.12 (here adv.); 13.8; ii.436.16,
17; iii.453.7; °nyasya i.27.7; 266.1; °nyasmiṃ i.16.10;

°nyehi arthehi; 358.11 (vs) ghoṣāṃs tatha cānyamanyān;
in this mg. also replaced by anyonya in prose generally,
but in Mv retained in prose: iii.390.5 °nyāhi parivrājikāhi.
