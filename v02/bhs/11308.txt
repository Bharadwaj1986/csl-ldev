{@bhūyasya, °syā, °so, bhūyosya@}¦, with (in Mv rarely
without) mātrayā (instr. of Skt. mātrā), or once mātrāṃ,
= Pali bhiyyoso-mattāya, adv. or adverbial phrase, {%in%}
{%specially high degree%}. The common BHS expression is
bhūyasyā (instr. fem. of Skt. bhūyas-) mātrayā, e.g. SP
23.1; LV 321.17; Mv ii.345.2 (vs, prob. read with v.l.
°sya, m.c.); exceptionally bhūyasya (a m.c.?) mātrāṃ
(so mss., Senart em. °aṃ) Mv ii.338.13 (vs); twice, at least,
in Mv the noun mātrayā is omitted (by error?), and text
presents bhūyasya (so, a! but here prose) alone, i.231.13.
or, acc. to Senart with 5 of 6 mss., bhūyosya (cf. Pali)
i.3.14 (prose); in SP 71.10 (prose) ed. with Nep. mss. has
the usual bhūyasyā mātrayā, but Kashgar rec. bhūyaso
(intending Skt. °śo; cf. Pali bhiyyoso) mātrayā. See also
s.v. {@yadbhūyasā@}.
