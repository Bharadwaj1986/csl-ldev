{@? karha-cid@}¦, adv. (cf. Skt. karhi-cid; = Pali karaha-
ci, only after kadā-ci, and in same mg. acc. to DN comm.
i.110.3), {%ever, at any time%}: in one old ms. of SP inserted
after kadācid SP 257.1 (prose), Baruch, Beiträge zum
Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra, 23 and 28; omitted in all
other mss. The coincidence with Pali usage is so extra-
ordinary that I am inclined with Baruch to regard it as
old.
