{@pratipadyati@}¦ (Pali paṭipajjati seems so used, but
hardly Skt.; cf. {@pratipatti, °pad, °panna@}), {%behaves%}, with
instr. of manner: yan nv aham alpāhāratayā pratipadyeyam
LV 254.2 (prose), {%suppose now I behave with (practise%}
{%according to the method of) taking scant food%}. This seems the
most probable interpretation; otherwise Tib., which ren-
ders the instr. -tayā by la, as if dative, and then has nan
tan bya ḥo, {%I shall make earnest effort to eat scant food%}; I
can hardly believe this is what the text means.
