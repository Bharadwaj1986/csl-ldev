{@Kṣemā, (1)@}¦ (= Pali Khemā) n. of Śākyamuni's
chief female disciple: Mv i.251.21 (agrā…śrāvikā); ({@2@})
n. of a daughter of King Prasenajit, who also became a
nun in the Buddha's order: Av ii.46.7 ff.; in 50.9 she is,
in fact, declared by Buddha to be agrā me…bhikṣu-
ṇīnāṃ mama śrāvikāṇāṃ, so that she is actually identified
with (1); her story, however (Av no. 79) is wholly different
from the story of Khemā in Pali. (Mv gives no story
about Kṣemā 1.).
