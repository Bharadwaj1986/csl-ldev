<L>295<pc>009,1<k1>अतित्ति<k2>अतित्ति-(ग-
{@atitti-(ga-)@}¦ ? (= Pali id., Skt. atṛpti); assumed by
Senart at Mv i.133.12 (prose) atittigāś (no ms. reads quite
so, yet the variants seem indeed to tend in this direction),
{%ils ne tendent pas à la satisfaction de leurs sens, ils ne sont%}
{%pas esclaves de leurs sens%}. It seems to me, however, that the
general use of derivatives of tṛp would suggest just the
opposite meaning, which would not fit here (ep. of Bodhi-
sattvas): {%they never reach satiety%}.
