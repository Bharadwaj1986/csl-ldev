{@utsadana@}¦, nt. (= {@utsīdana@}; with mg. 1 cf. Skt.
utsīdati; with mg. 2 cf. prec. and {@an-utsanna@}), ({@1@}) {%coming%}
{%to grief, ruin%}: sthale utsadanam MSV i.49.10, 17 (in 2
above read utsatsyati for utpat°); ({@2@}) {%superfluous abun-%}
{%dance, excess%}, in °na-dharmakaṃ (bhaktaṃ) Divy 307.23,
27, of food offered to monks and not fully used by them,
{%of the nature of excess%} (pw 7.323 {%zum Wegräumen bestimmt%}).
For Mvy 6781 utsādanam = Tib. dril ba ({%rolling%}, in sense
of {%rubbing down, massage%}; so Skt.), Minayev and Mironov
read utsadanam, apparently a faulty reading.
