{@sahaśāyinī@}¦ (cf. Pali sahaseyya, recorded only as m.,
{%bedfellow%} of another monk), {%bedfellow%} (f.); so I believe we

at Mv iii.86.19 only), deriving from root śī; (pra)suptāye
°nīye (mss. sahasāpinīye) Mv iii.82.13 and 15 (vss); saha-
śāyinībhiḥ (mss. saha-sāy°) 87.12 (vs); °nīye (here mss.
hopelessly corrupt) śayitāye iii.74.18.
