{@pratisṛjyati@}¦ (4th class pres. to prati-sṛj-, which in
Skt. is rare and doubtful, and seems recorded nowhere
else), {%abandons, gives up%}: icchema (mss. ikṣema; read
īkṣema?) pratisṛjyantau icchema (so most mss., two ikṣema)
maraṇam ātmanaḥ Mv i.181.1 (vs),…{%abandoning%} (life),
{%we desire our own death%}. (Otherwise but implausibly Se-
nart.) Note several cpds. of sṛj in Mvy 2547-58, including
prati-ni-, prati-vi-ni-; and the 4th class pres. {@utsṛjyate@}
(not pass.) 2558.
