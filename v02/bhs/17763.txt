{@hema-jāla@}¦ (not noted as cpd. in Skt.; Pali id., de-
fined as covering for gift-elephants, gift-chariots, a heavenly
mansion or vimāna and the body of a possessor of one;
AMg. °jālaga, {%a kind of ornament%}, Ratnach.), lit. {%gold-net%},
but seems to have acquired a special mg., which is not
clear: in Mv i.171.8 (vs) one of the 60 qualities of a Buddha's
voice is that it is hemajāla-tulya-ravā, {%sounding like a…%};
in Mv i.195.5 the {%railing-networks%} (vedikā-jāla, see {@vedikā@})
of Dīpavatī, and in 196.4 each of its city gates, are covered
with two hemajāla, one of gold and the other of silver!
(195.5) dvihi hemajālehi praticchannā abhūṣi suvarṇa-
mayena ca °lena rūpyamayena ca; the next sentence, both
times, says that the golden hemajāla had bells of silver,
the silver one bells of gold; Senart supposes that hema-
has come to mean {%precious substance%} in general, but I
know of nothing else to support this; on the other hand,
in Mv ii.453.17 the lit. mg. may well apply, elephants
being described as hemajāla-praticchanna (misprinted
hemalāla° in text), as in Pali AN iv. 393.21 (°saṃchanna).
