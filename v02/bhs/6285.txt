{@citritaka@}¦, adj. (Skt. °ta with endearing dim. -ka,
§ 22.34), {%made bright, adorned%}: (tava rūpa surūpa suśo-
bhanake) vasavarti sulakṣaṇa citritake LV 321.(21--)22
(vs); said by the daughters of Māra to the Bodhisattva;
the e-forms seem scarcely construable with suvasantake
in line 19 (nor does Tib. take them so; Calc. reads suśo-
bhanako and citritako, but all mss. °ke in both); accord-
ingly it seems that, if the mss. are right, we must under-
stand them either as n. sg. nt. in e, with rūpa (§ 8.37),
or as voc. sg. m., addressed to the Bodhisattva (§ 8.28).
