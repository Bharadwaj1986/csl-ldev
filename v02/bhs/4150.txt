{@evarūpa@}¦, adj. (= Pali id.; Skt. evaṃrūpa), {%of such%}
{%a sort%} or {%form%}: very common in vss, SP 83.14; 86.14;
93.4; 94.1; 95.4, 12; 96.8; 97.6; LV 55.9; Dbh.g. 12(348).16;
[Page157-b+ 71]
Sukh 50.12; but also in prose, esp. of Mv, e.g. i.39.8;
329.7, 21; 330.11; ii.257.12; iii.317.7; 444.6, etc.; also in
prose of LV, 13.22 and 307.13 (so all Lefm.'s mss. and
Weller's ms., certainly not misprint as suggested by Weller
16), as well as 441.12, eṣām evarūpāṇāṃ dharmāṇāṃ
(no v.l. except Calc. evaṃrū°, cited by Lefm., so that
evarū° is not a misprint; not noted by Weller). Pali also
uses evarūpa in prose as well as verse. (PTSD cites this
cpd. under eva; of course it should be under evaṃ.) Cf.
{@keva-rūpa@}.
