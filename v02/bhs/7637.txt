{@dviruttarapadasaṃdhi-lipi@}¦, a kind of writing: LV
126.8; Tib. tshig lan lan gñis su gdab paḥi tshig gi mtshams
kyi (yi ge), which Foucaux renders, {%(écriture) du saṃdhi%}
{%(liaison) d'un mot répété deux fois%}, which does not make
much sense to me, nor can I see how it renders the Tib.
(which however I find obscure). The text continues: yāvad-
daśottarapadasaṃdhi-lipiṃ; this time Tib. is rather dif-
ferent, tshig gi mtshams bcur brgyud paḥi bar gyi (yi ge),
which Foucaux renders as before (with {%ten%} for {%two%}); it
seems to mean {%writing up to a series of ten%} (forming) {%a%}
{%combination of words%}, or {%writing of combinations of words%}
{%in which up to ten words follow one another%}. Possibly dvirut-
tara° means no more than {%writing of two words in com-%}
{%bination%}.
