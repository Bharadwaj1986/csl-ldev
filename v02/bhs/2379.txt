{@asaṃvṛta, (1)@}¦ adj. (= Pali asaṃvuta; apparently
not in this sense in Skt., tho saṃvṛta {%restrained%} occurs),
{%uncontrolled, unrestrained%} (cf. {@saṃvara, saṃvṛti@}): LV
87.13; 138.13; vācā asaṃ° MSV ii.210.14; ({@2@}) subst. nt.:
[Page082-b+ 71]
LV 372.7 (vs) ṣoḍaśa asaṃvṛtānī {%the 16 uncontrolled things%}
(…chinnāni mayeha saṃsthena; said by the Buddha at
the Bodhimaṇḍa). I have no clue to what is meant and have
found no parallel. The passage is omitted in Foucaux's
Tib.; his transl. of Skt. says {%omissions%}. Cf. asaṃvara,
{%‘indiscipline’%}, AbhidhK. LaV-P. iv. 57 (?).
