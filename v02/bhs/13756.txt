{@vijñāna@}¦, nt. (in mgs. 3--5 = Pali viññāna; orig. in
Skt., {%practical knowledge%}, opp. to {@jñāna@}, {%theoretical know-%}
{%ledge%}, see Edgerton, Festschrift Winternitz, 217 ff.), ({@1@})
{%practical knowledge, applied knowledge%}, as in Skt., still
clearly in LV 422.13 durvijñānaṃ (or v.l. °jñeyaṃ) tac
cakraṃ jñāna-vijñāna-samatānubaddhatvāt, {%this wheel%} (of
the Doctrine) {%is hard to know%} (practically), {%because it is%}
[Page486-a+ 71]
{%inseparably connected with identify of theoretical and prac-%}
{%tical knowledge%} (i.e. can only be known by one whose
theoretical knowledge is at the same time applied in
practice); in Laṅk 156.11 ff. a dissertation on the dif-
ference between jñāna and vi°, rendered by Suzuki, Studies
272, {%transcendental%} (i.e. absolute) {%and%} (merely) {%relative%}
{%knowledge%}; I should prefer {%abstract%} and {%applied knowledge%};
but it is true that to the author of Laṅk {%applied knowledge%}
(vij°) has only {%practical%}, and hence in the last analysis
no {%real%}, application; the passage cited makes this very
clear. Essentially similar is the contrast in jñāna-prati-
saraṇena bhavitavyaṃ, na vijñāna-pratisaraṇena Mvy
1548; more at length Bbh 257.16 ff. bodhisattvaḥ adhi-
gama-jñāne sāradarśī bhavati, na śruta-cintā-dharmārtha-
vijñāna-mātrake; sa yad bhāvanāmayena jñānena jñāta-
vyaṃ na tac chakyaṃ śrutacintā-vijñāna-mātrakeṇa
vijñātum iti viditvā paramagambhīrān api tathāgatabhā-
ṣitāṃ dharmān śrutvā na pratikṣipati; ({@2@}) two kinds of
vi°, {@khyāti-vi°@} and {@vastuprativikalpa-vi°@}, qq.v., Laṅk
37.14 f.; vi° is aṣṭa-lakṣaṇa, ib., the list of 8 being given
235.7 ff., Suzuki, Studies, 189 (‘Ālaya, Manas, Manovi-
jñāna, and the five sense-vijñāna’, on which see {@dhātu@} 3;
the sixth is mano-vij°); ({@3@}) the sixth of the six ‘elements’,
see {@dhātu@} 1b; ({@4@}) the fifth of the five {@(upādāna-)skandha@},
qq.v.; ({@5@}) the third link in the {@pratītyasamutpāda@}, q.v.
In the last four categories often rendered {%consciousness%},
etc.; no single word or brief phrase can, of course, really
suffice. In Bbh 49.17--18 (see s.v. {@naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā°@})
short for {@vijñānānantyāyatana@}, in a cpd.
