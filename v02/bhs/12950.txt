{@labhā@}¦ (m.c., see below), {@labhyaṃ, labhyā@}, indecl.
(= Pali labbhā), {%(it is) possible%}, usually in the sense of
{%allowable%}; usually with infin., the ‘logical subject’ of which
is instr. and the ‘logical object’ nom., showing that, as
with (Skt.) śakya and BHS {@śakyā@}, the infin. is (or may
be) passive in mg.; it happens often that this ‘logical
object’ (nom.) is fem., which might tempt one to consider
labhyā a fem. adj., but in one case at least labhyā…
puruṣo occurs, which, with Pali labbhā and BHS śakyā,
helps to prove that all these forms are indecl.; without
infin., evaṃ labhyaṃ Mv ii.272.10, {%it is possible so%}; with
finite verb, labhyaṃ satpuruṣā pratyāgacchanti akuśalena
karmaṇā vipratisārī bhavanti Mv i.37.4, {%it is possible,%}
{%good men%} (may) {%backslide, and%} (afterwards) {%feel remorse%}
{%for their evil action%} (wrongly Senart); labhā, m.c. for (Pali)
labbhā or (BHS) labhyā, in Mv ii.144.5 (vs), read with
mss. parityajya dhṛtir labhā, {%by abandoning%} (worldly
things), {%steadfastness is possible%} (obtainable), wrongly
Senart; with infin., labhyā strībhiḥ puruṣo (with mss.,
Senart wrongly em. °ṣaṃ) vāhayituṃ Mv ii.480.3, {%can%}
{%women cause a man to carry them?%} (cf. line 6 below,
with 1 ms., na śakyo yuṣmābhir eṣo vāhayituṃ); labhyā
etena…agramahiṣī (mss.; Senart em. °ṣīṃ)…āhanituṃ
ii.455.20, {%can he%} (be allowed to) {%strike the chief queen?%};
so also 457.3 °mahiṣī (mss., Senart °ṣīṃ); no labhyā
yuṣmābhiḥ anyam-anyaṃ (adv.) tyajituṃ iii.151.12, and,
na labhyā yuṣmābhiḥ parasparasya (adv.) tyajituṃ 19,
{%you may not be mutually abandoned (by one-another)%}; na
labhyaṃ atra puruṣeṇa praviśituṃ Mv iii.151.7, {%a man%}
{%may not enter here%}; MSV i.249.12 (see {@āmiṣa@}); labhyā
mithyādṛṣṭiḥ prahātuṃ Mvy 7027, {%heresy can (may) be%}
{%abandoned%} (Tib. nus pa, {%possible%}, or ruṅ ba, {%proper, right%});
labhyam ebhir adharmeṇa karmaṇā kartum MSV iii.117.4,
{%it is possible%} (here not {%allowable%}) {%that they may act by an%}
