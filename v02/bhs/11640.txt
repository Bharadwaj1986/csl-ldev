[{@masniya@}¦, v.l. maśniya, as n. of an animal: Mv
i.349.20 (balivardehi) vā °yehi vā ajehi vā eḍakehi vā…
Senart recognizes the word as corrupt, and suggests
(Pali) meṇḍehi; this may well be approximately right,
but the precise form may be {@miṇḍha@}, q.v., for which
Lefm.'s text of LV reads miśṛ-, suggesting something
resembling the Mv corruption.]
