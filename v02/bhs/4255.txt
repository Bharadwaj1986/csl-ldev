{@osaraṇa@}¦, nt. (to next; = Pali id.), {%entrance, approach%}:
Mv ii.37.9 osaraṇe (mss. osakaṇe) ca bharitā addaśi
pramadā, {%at the entrance%} (to the king's palace)…(other-
wise Senart); ii.108.8 kasya eṣa osaraṇaśabdaḥ (? mss.
te saraṇa°, or te śaraśa°), {%whose noise of approach is this?%}
In Mv iii.401.1 osaraṇāni, in a line otherwise hopelessly
corrupt, corresponds to the same word in the same vs
of Pali Sn 538, the rest of which seems also corrupt (so
ed.); the comm. says it means {%heretical views%} (ogahanāni
titthāni, diṭṭhiyo). Senart's em. and interpretation of the
line are unconvincing; but the Pali is also dubious, and
its comm. questionable. I cannot solve the problem.
