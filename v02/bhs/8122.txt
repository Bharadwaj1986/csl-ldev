{@nāga-nadī@}¦, {%‘river of nāgas (serpent-demons)’%}, epithet
of the Nairañjanā, given to it because nāgas lived in it
(LV 270.2 ff.), as in the Pali (see 1 Nerañjarā, DPPN):
(bodhisattvas…) nāganadīṃ (10) pūrvāhna- (v.l. °hne)
kālasamaye nadī- (so mss., Lefm. nadīṃ) nairañjanām
upasaṃkramya…(11) nadīṃ (so Lefm., but most and
best mss. nadī-, again) nairañjanām avatarati sma LV
269.9 ff.; this word is confirmed by Tib. which also con-
nects it syntactically with nadī-nair° of line 10, kluḥi ({%of%}
{%nāgas%}) kluṅ ({%river%}) chu bo ({%water, river%}) nai ra ñja naḥi
({%of the N%}.) ṅogs su ({%to the bank%}) soṅ ste ({%being gone%}); similarly
twice in Mv,…nāganadī- (so mss., Senart wrongly
°nandī)-kālasamaye (does this mean {%betimes, at the appro-%}
{%priate hour?%} cf. {@nadī-kālasamaya@}; perhaps {%at the proper%}
{%time for%} [bathing in] {%the nāga-river?%}) yena (?this word may
not have been in the text) nadī-nairañjanā (v.l. °nān)
tenopasaṃkramitvā…Mv ii.131.11; and similarly ii.264.3,
except that here one ms. is reported to read -nandī-
(instead of nadī-)kālasamaye with Senart's text (and both
have nāma- for nāga-), but the LV parallel (and reading of
the other ms. here and both in 131.11) proves this wrong.
