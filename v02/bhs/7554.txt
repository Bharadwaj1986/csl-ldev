{@? deśayin@}¦, {%teaching%} (the Doctrine); perhaps so inter-
pret SP 272.5 (vs) raseṣu gṛddha saktāś ca gṛhīṇāṃ
dharma deśayī, satkṛtāś ca bhaviṣyanti…, (will, in later
ages, be) {%teaching the Doctrine to householders%}, n. pl. m.(?);
but perhaps better as 3 pl. (in form sg.) opt., like deśayuḥ
line 10, from deśayati (altho verb forms in this passage
are mostly fut.).
