{@nivāsayati@}¦, generally as in Skt. {%puts on%} (a garment,
regularly undergarment). So also Pali nivāseti, wrongly
defined in PTSD {%to dress oneself…to get clothed or dressed%}.
It is true that in the common cliché (kālyam eva, or the
like) nivāsayitvā, LV 240.11 (vs); Mv i.34.14; 54.10;
307.14; iii.60.3; 255.15; 272.5; 414.5; or nivāsya, LV
407.13; Divy 20.2; Av i.290.16, etc.; no object is expressed.
It is unnecessary to say what the monk puts on before
starting his round of begging; the gerund however means
strictly {%having put on%} (sc. the undergarment; cf. Prāt
527.8 cīvaraṃ nivāsayiṣyāmaḥ, with Chin. transl.; contrast
prāvariṣyāmaḥ 529.1 ff., of the upper garment; same
contrast in Pali, Vin. iv.185.18, 27). Once the verb is
used in the causal sense of {%cause%} (someone else) {%to put on%}
(an undergarment): Bhīk 11a.4 nivāsanaṃ nivāsayitavyā,
(the nun) {%is to be caused%} (by the instructress) {%to put on the%}
{%undergarment%}.
