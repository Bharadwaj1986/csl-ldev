{@diśi@}¦ (= AMg. disi, for Skt. diś, diśā; not in Pali),
{%direction%}. Noted only in Mmk, but not rare there; usually
acc. sg. diśim; sometimes (notably 205.26, where it seems
clearly to be taken so, § 4.59, end) this could be interpreted
as loc. diśi plus ‘hiatus-bridging’ m; among the cases
which are certainly acc. are: dakṣiṇāṃ diśim āśritāḥ
Mmk 326.18, and…āśritya 626.26; prāciṃ (°cīṃ) diśim
upādāya 620.1 (these all vss). The great corruption of the
text of Mmk might tempt to emendation (diśam would be
easy), but AMg. seems to confirm the form.
