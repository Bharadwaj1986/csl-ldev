({@itara@}¦, adj., {%commonplace, low, vulgar%}, = Pali itara
and ittara, but also Skt. itara, BR 5.1139; hence not a
specifically Buddhist word; doubtless specialized semantic
development of itara, {%other%}: e.g. LV 88.11 itara-jātīyāḥ,
{%commonplace, vulgar people%}. No *ittara has been recorded,
but see {@itvara@}, which is presumed to be its Skt. original.)
