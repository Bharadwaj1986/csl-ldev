{@pragharati, parighareti@}), {%drips, flows%} (intrans.): Mv
iii.408.1 kāsāṃcil lālā (mss. lolā) gharati (or with v.l.
gharanti; in accord with this read in Mv i.227.17--18
kāsāṃcil (ed. with mss. kācil) lālā gharanti (kācil would
require transitive mg. for gharanti, lālā being then acc.;
but the verb and its cpds. seem to be only intrans.).
