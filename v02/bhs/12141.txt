{@muditā, (1)@}¦ (= Pali id.; acc. to Senart, Mv i.629
and iii.523, also PTSD s.v., an altered form of mudutā,
= Skt. mṛdutā, which has a quite diff. mg. in Pali), {%joy%}
(esp. of the spirit); so the unanimous tradition, both of
Pali comms., and of northern texts and transl.; if orig.
derived from Skt. mṛdu-tā, all practical traces of this
origin have certainly been lost; the word is always asso-
ciated with root mud, as is proved by a number of clear
descriptions, cited below; esp. as one (usually the 3d) of
the four {@apramāṇa@} or {@brahmavihāra@}, qq.v. (with
{@maitrī@} or {@maitrā@}, karuṇā, and {@upekṣā@}), LV 8.4; 112.6;
183.3; 275.18; 297.12; 376.1, 2; 426.4; Mv i.357.19;
ii.362.5 (here upekṣā omitted); iii.421.14, 22; Mvy 1506;
Dbh 34.21; Bbh 209.4; 236.7; 241.16; Sādh 57.13 ff.;
AbhidhK. LaV--P. viii.196 ({%joie%}), citing the vyākhyā,
muditā cārateḥ pratipakṣaḥ saumanasyarūpatvāt; with
this cf. Mvy 1599, aratiniḥsaraṇaṃ muditā; similar de-
scription in Sādh l.c. (57.18 hṛṣṭacittatā); esp. elaborate
description Śikṣ 183.4, katamā muditā?…prītiḥ pra-
sādaḥ prāmodyaṃ cittasyānavalīnatā…cittasya prāmo-
dyaṃ kāyasyaudbilyaṃ buddheḥ saṃpraharṣaṇaṃ manasa
utplavaḥ etc.; Tib. regularly dgaḥ ba, {%joy%}; ({@2@}) rarely,
and only in vss (prob. m.c.), = {@pramuditā@} as n. of the
first bodhisattva-bhūmi: Laṅk 286.15; Sūtrāl. xx--xxi.32.
