{@unmijitakā@}¦ (?), {%a turning sideways%}: in śīrṣonmijita-
[Page133-a+ 71]
kayā, instr., LV 62.21 (prose), {%with a turning of their heads%}
{%to one side%} (they gazed at the Blessed One); of gods. So
apparently Tib. mgo byol nas. Is the word somehow
related to un-miñj- (see the foll. words)? The only v.l.
is A śīrṣāmiñjitakāyā; I have thought of śīrsāniñjita-
kāyā(ḥ), {%with bodies unmoved as to the heads%} (see {@aniñjita@}).
But Tib. clearly had no such reading (and no word for {%body%}).
