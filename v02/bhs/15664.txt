{@satkāya@}¦, m. (= Pali sakkāya), {%real, existent, body;%}
{%individuality, personality%}: mā…imaṃ…satkāyaṃ kāyaṃ
manyadhvam AsP 94.12, {%don't think this existent (physical)%}
{%body%} (of Tathāgatas) {%is their body%} (but rather regard the
{@dharmakāya@} as such); virtually = ātman, once at least
in neutral or even favorable sense, prītibhakṣā bhaviṣyāmo
satkāyenopaniḥśritāḥ (read °niśritāḥ) Ud xxx.50, {%we shall%}
{%feed on joy, relying on our selves%} (alone, not dependent
on anything outside); but commonly in unfavorable sense,
of the personality to believe in which is a heresy ({@dṛṣṭi@},
see next); satkāyasaṃjñīkṛtaṃ (sc. śarīraṃ) LV 208.13
(vs), {%formed thru the false notion of the personality%}; nārāyaṇa-
bhūtaṃ satkāya-dharma-nistāḍana-tayā Gv 495.6,…{%be-%}
{%cause it puts down the qualities of the individuality%}. There
seems little doubt of the etym. and fundamental meaning
of this word (probably no one now agrees with Childers
that it was orig. sva-kāya); and the scholastic fantasies
of various schools listed by LaV-P. in AbhidhK. v.15--17
need not be recorded here, tho they evidently influenced
Tib. and Chin. interpretations.
