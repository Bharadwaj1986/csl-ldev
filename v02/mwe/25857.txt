SACRAMENT¦, {%s.%} {#संस्कारः, महायज्ञः#}. For the twelve sanskāras or
sacred symbolical rites, {%see%} RITE. The following are the
five mahā-yajnas, or great sacraments of the Hindūs (as
explained in Manu III. 70. {%et. seq.%}), appointed to be per-
formed every day by the Grihastha, or house-keeper, for
the sake of expiating the sin incurred by the involuntary
destruction of minute living creatures. They refer re-
spectively to what is due to five objects, viz. himself,
the gods, his fore-fathers, spirits or ghosts, and men or
guests. 1. Study of Scripture, with prayer and medita-
tion, called {#ब्रह्मयज्ञः#} or {#अहुतः#}. 2. Offering oblations to
the gods in fire, called {#देवयज्ञः#} or {#हुतः#}. 3. Offering libations
of water and cakes to the manes of deceased ancestors,
called {#पितृयज्ञः#} or {#प्राशितं#} or {#श्राद्धं#}. 4. Casting the residue
of oblations on the ground or in water, as an offering
to spirits or goblins, called {#भूतयज्ञः#} or {#बलियज्ञः#} or {#प्रहुतः#} or
{#आहुतः#} or {#बलिः#} {%m.%} 5. Receiving guests, and especially
Brahmans, with hospitality, called {#नृयज्ञः#} or {#मनुप्पयज्ञः#} or
{#ब्राह्म्यहुतं#} or {#ब्राह्म्यं#} or {#ब्रह्महुतं#}. The Viṣnu-Purāna adds two
other sacraments, viz. ‘propagation of offspring,’ {#प्रजापतियज्ञः,#}
and ‘observance of truth,’ {#सत्ययज्ञः,#} but these are com-
paratively modern additions. The Christian idea of a sa-
crament may be expressed by {#संस्कारः#} or {#ख्रीष्टप्रकल्पितसंस्कारः;#}
as, ‘the sacrament of baptism,’ {#जलसंस्कारः#} or {#जलसेचनसंस्कारः#}
or {#मज्जनसंस्कारः;#} ‘of the Lord's Supper,’ {#ख्रीष्टभोजनसंस्कारः#}
or {#ख्रीष्टमृन्युरमरणार्थकसंस्कारः#}.
