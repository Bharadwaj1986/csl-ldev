<div n="lb"/>KĀMADEVA¦, {%s.%} (The god of love or Hindu Cupid, son of Vishnu
<div n="lb"/>or Krishna by Lakṣmī, who is then called Māyā or
<div n="lb"/>Rukminī. According to another account he was first
<div n="lb"/>produced in the heart of Brahmā, and coming out in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a beautiful female, was looked upon by Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mā with amorous emotions. He is usually represented
<div n="lb"/>as a handsome youth, sometimes riding on a parrot,
<div n="lb"/>and attended by nymphs, one of whom bears his banner,
<div n="lb"/>which consists of a fish on a red ground. Endeavouring
<div n="lb"/>to influence Śiva with the passion of love for his wife
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī, he discharged an arrow at him; but Śiva, enraged
<div n="lb"/>at the attempt, reduced him to ashes, or as some say, to
<div n="lb"/>a mere mental essence, by a beam of fire darted from
<div n="lb"/>his central eye. Afterwards the relenting god declared
<div n="lb"/>that he should be born again in the form of Pradyumna,
<div n="lb"/>son of Krishna by Māyā or Rukminī. The bow of
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva is made of flowers, with a string formed of
<div n="lb"/>bees, and his five arrows are each tipped with the blos-
<div n="lb"/>som of a flower which is devoted to, and supposed to
<div n="lb"/>preside over, a sense. He is lord of the Apsarasas. As
