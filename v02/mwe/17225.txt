<div n="lb"/>KRISHNA¦, {%s.%} (The most celebrated form of Vishnu, or rather
<div n="lb"/>identified with Vishnu, as distinct from his ten Avatārs,
<div n="lb"/>or Incarnations. The following particulars of the history
<div n="lb"/>of this very popular deity, whose votaries are still so
<div n="lb"/>numerous in India are given as an introduction to the
<div n="lb"/>enumeration of his various names. Vasudeva, a descendant
<div n="lb"/>of Yadu and Yayāti, had two wives, Rohinī and Devakī.
<div n="lb"/>The latter had eight sons, of whom the eighth was Krishna.
<div n="lb"/>Kansa, a demon, the sister of Devakī, and king of Mathurā,
<div n="lb"/>was informed by the gods that one of these sons would
<div n="lb"/>kill him. He therefore kept Vasudeva and his wife
<div n="lb"/>Devakī in confinement in his palace, and slew their first
<div n="lb"/>six children. The seventh son was Balarāma, who was
<div n="lb"/>saved by being abstracted from the womb of Devakī, and
<div n="lb"/>transferred to that of Rohinī. The eighth was Krishna,
<div n="lb"/>[Page430-b+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>who was born with kin as black as the dark leaves of the
<div n="lb"/>lotus, and with a peculiar mark on his breast: he was
<div n="lb"/>born at midnight, and immediately taken up by Vasudeva,
<div n="lb"/>who, favoured by the gods, was able to elude the vigilance
<div n="lb"/>of the guards, and make his escape through the gates of
<div n="lb"/>Mathurā to the banks of the Yamunā river. Here Sesha,
<div n="lb"/>the many-headed serpent, spread his hoods above the
<div n="lb"/>heads of the father and child, and thus protecting them,
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva was enabled to cross the stream, and finding a
<div n="lb"/>a cowherd named Nanda, whose wife Yaśodā had just been
<div n="lb"/>delivered of a child, he quietly substituted his own son in
<div n="lb"/>its place, and returned with the child of the cowherd to
<div n="lb"/>the bedside of Devakī. When Kansa found that the infant
<div n="lb"/>Krishna had escaped, he summoned certain demons, his
<div n="lb"/>servants, and gave orders that a search should be
<div n="lb"/>made for the child, and that all male children in whom
<div n="lb"/>were signs of unusual vigour, should be killed. At the
<div n="lb"/>same time he released Vasudeva and his wife, as no
<div n="lb"/>longer endangering his safety. The cowherd Nanda,
<div n="lb"/>with his wife Yaśodā, taking the infant Krishna, and
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by Rohinī and the infant Balarāma, went to
<div n="lb"/>reside at a village called Gokula, or Vraja, where they
<div n="lb"/>settled. Here the female demon Pūtanā tried to destroy
<div n="lb"/>the young Krishna by offering him her breast to suck,
<div n="lb"/>but was killed by the child. Soon the child, with his
<div n="lb"/>playfellow Balarāma, began to be unruly; and one day
<div n="lb"/>his foster-mother passed the folds of a rope round his body
<div n="lb"/>and tied him to a large wooden bowl, but the strength of
<div n="lb"/>the young Krishna enabled him to drag the bowl against
<div n="lb"/>the trunks of two trees, which were uprooted by the shock.
<div n="lb"/>The family of Nanda now removed from Vraja to Vṛndā-
<div n="lb"/>vana, and here Krishna and Balarāma grew up together,
<div n="lb"/>and, roaming about the woods, joined in the sports of the
<div n="lb"/>herdsmen's sons. One day Krishna came to the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Yamunā, within which was the fearful pool of the
<div n="lb"/>serpent Kāliya. Krishna jumped boldly in. A terrible
<div n="lb"/>combat ensued, in which the divine child was victorious,
<div n="lb"/>and commanded the snake-king to depart from the Yamunā
<div n="lb"/>to the ocean. About the same time Balarāma killed
<div n="lb"/>the demon Dhenuka, who sought to destroy the two boys,
<div n="lb"/>and soon afterwards killed the demon Pralamba, who had
<div n="lb"/>assumed the shape of a young cowherd, that he might
<div n="lb"/>mix in their sports. Not long after, the young Krishna,
<div n="lb"/>who delighted in playing tricks upon his elders, resolved to
<div n="lb"/>rouse the anger of the god Indra, who, according to some,
<div n="lb"/>was his elder brother. He persuaded Nanda to cease
<div n="lb"/>sacrificing to Indra, and to worship the mountain Govard-
<div n="lb"/>hana, which sheltered the shepherds and their cattle. This
<div n="lb"/>they did. but the exasperated Indra would have destroyed
<div n="lb"/>them and their flocks with heavy rain, had not Krishna
<div n="lb"/>lifted up the mountain and sheltered them under it. Indra,
<div n="lb"/>[Page431-a+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>foiled in his revenge, descended from heaven to praise
<div n="lb"/>Krishna, and made him lord over the cattle, Meanwhile
<div n="lb"/>Krishna had grown a beautiful youth, and soon began to
<div n="lb"/>sport with the Gopīs, or shepherdesses, of whom seven or
<div n="lb"/>eight became his wives, and amongst them his favorite,
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā. In this character he is usually represented with
<div n="lb"/>flowing hair and with a flute in his hand, and has been
<div n="lb"/>compared to Apollo accompanied by the muses. In his
<div n="lb"/>pastimes with the shepherdesses he invented a kind of
<div n="lb"/>round dance, called Rāsa or Mandala nrityam, in which he
<div n="lb"/>and Rādhā being in the centre, the attendant Gopīs danced
<div n="lb"/>round them. But the happiness of Krishna was inter-
<div n="lb"/>rupted by his tyrannical uncle Kansa, who sent formidable
<div n="lb"/>demons to destroy him; Arishta, in the form of a bull,
<div n="lb"/>Keśin, in the form of a horse, Kālanemi, and others.
<div n="lb"/>They were all killed by the young Krishna. Kansa then
<div n="lb"/>sent a messenger, named Akrūra, to entice Krishna and
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma to his city Mathurā, under pretext of being
<div n="lb"/>present at some games. They accepted the invitation
<div n="lb"/>and went. At the entrance of the town Krishna killed
<div n="lb"/>Kansa's washerman, who insulted him. Having clothed
<div n="lb"/>himself in the washerman's yellow clothes, he proceeded,
<div n="lb"/>and meeting a crooked woman carrying ointment,
<div n="lb"/>miraculously made her straight by a touch of his hand.
<div n="lb"/>At the games he killed the king's boxer, Chānūra, and
<div n="lb"/>afterwards Kansa himself, and placed Kansa's father,
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena, upon the throne. He then became the pupil
<div n="lb"/>of Sāndīpani, and, to rescue his son, killed the demon
<div n="lb"/>Panchajana, and, taking the conch shell, formed of his
<div n="lb"/>bones, bore it as his horn. Still living in Mathurā, he was
<div n="lb"/>attacked by a prince named Kālayavana, who advanced
<div n="lb"/>with a large force against the Yadu tribe. Upon this
<div n="lb"/>Krishna built and fortified a city called Dvāraka, in the
<div n="lb"/>province of Guzerat, and thither transferred the inhabi-
<div n="lb"/>tants of Mathurā. One day Krishna went forth unarmed,
<div n="lb"/>and, being pursued by Kālayavana, took refuge in a cavern,
<div n="lb"/>where Muchukunda, king of men, was asleep. Kālaya-
<div n="lb"/>vana, entering the cavern, was reduced to ashes by an
<div n="lb"/>angry glance from the eye of Muchukunda. Krishna
<div n="lb"/>then returned to Dvāraka. Soon after he was accused of
<div n="lb"/>stealing a wonderful jewel called ‘syamantaka,’ in the
<div n="lb"/>possession of a man named Prasena. But the jewel was
<div n="lb"/>really lost by the death of Prasena in a forest, and was
<div n="lb"/>picked up by a lion, who, in his turn, was killed by the
<div n="lb"/>king of the bears, Jāmbavat. The latter took the jewel to
<div n="lb"/>his cavern, where he was found by Krishna, and com-
<div n="lb"/>pelled to restore the gem. At the same time the bear
<div n="lb"/>gave him his daughter Jāmbavatī in marriage. He next
<div n="lb"/>married Satyabhāmā, daughter of Satrājit, and afterward
<div n="lb"/>carried off Rukminī, daughter of Bhīṣmaka. By the
<div n="lb"/>latter he had a son called Pradyumna, who is usually
<div n="lb"/>[Page431-b+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>identified with Kāmadeva, the god of love, and a daughter
<div n="lb"/>named Chārumatī, as well as many other children. Be-
<div n="lb"/>sides these wives he had more than sixteen thousand
<div n="lb"/>others, who bore him a numerous progeny of one hundred
<div n="lb"/>and eighty thousand sons. The other incidents of his life
<div n="lb"/>are thus briefly related. Indra came to Dvāraka, and
<div n="lb"/>reported to Krishna the tyranny of the demon Naraka.
<div n="lb"/>Krishna went to his city, and slew him and another demon
<div n="lb"/>named Mura, who assisted in the defence of the city. He
<div n="lb"/>afterwards ascended to the heaven of Indra, with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā, and, visiting the gardens of Swarga, was in-
<div n="lb"/>duced by his wife to carry off the Pāṛjāta tree, or cele-
<div n="lb"/>brated tree of Paradise. Sachī, the wife of Indra, excited
<div n="lb"/>her husband to its rescue, and a conflict ensued between
<div n="lb"/>the gods and Krishna, who defeated them, and carried the
<div n="lb"/>tree to Dvāraka. Soon after this, Uṣā, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>the Daitya Bāna, became enamoured of Aniruddha, son of
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna and grandson of Krishna, and induced her
<div n="lb"/>father to carry him off. Krishna, Balarāma, and Prad-
<div n="lb"/>yumna, came to his rescue. Siva and Skanda aided Bāna,
<div n="lb"/>but the former was disabled and the latter put to flight;
<div n="lb"/>and Krishna, encountering Bāna, cut off all his arms. After
<div n="lb"/>this, Paundraka, one of the family of Vasudeva, assumed
<div n="lb"/>the insignia and title of Krishna, and was supported by
<div n="lb"/>the king of Benares. Krishna advanced against them,
<div n="lb"/>mounted on his vehicle Garuda, and having destroyed
<div n="lb"/>them, set fire to Benares by the radiance from his chakra
<div n="lb"/>or discus. Lastly, being recalled by the gods to heaven,
<div n="lb"/>he destroyed all his own family the Yādavas. Amongst
<div n="lb"/>them died Balarāma, out of whose mouth, as he expired,
<div n="lb"/>issued the great serpent, Ananta or Sesha, of which he
<div n="lb"/>was an incarnation. Krishna himself was killed by a
<div n="lb"/>chance shot from a hunter, and again became one with the
<div n="lb"/>Universal Spirit. From this summary of the history of
<div n="lb"/>Krishna his various names will become intelligible.
<div n="lb"/>Many of these names, as well as many of his attributes
<div n="lb"/>and peculiarities, are identical with those of Vishnu. {%See%}
