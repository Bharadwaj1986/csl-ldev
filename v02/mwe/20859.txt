OF¦, {%prep.%} expressed generally by the genitive case; as, ‘of
me,’ {#मम;#} ‘of him,’ {#तस्य;#} ‘of that man,’ {#तस्य पुरुषस्य#}. It
is frequently expressed by the crude form of a noun in
the first member of a compound; as, ‘best of all,’ {#सर्व्वश्रेष्ठः#}
{#-ष्ठा -ष्ठं;#} ‘lord of men,’ {#नरपतिः#} {%m.;%} ‘made of wood,’ {#काष्ठ-#}
{#निर्म्मितः -ता -तं#}. When it denotes ‘out of,’ ‘from amongst,’
it is expressed by {#मध्यात्#} or {#मध्ये,#} affixed to the gen. c., or
crude form; as, ‘of all men,’ {#सर्व्वपुरुषमध्यात्#} or {#सर्व्वपुरुषाणां#}
{#मध्यात्#} or {#मध्ये#}. It may sometimes be rendered by the
abl. c., in phrases where ‘from’ may be substituted in
English; as, ‘of a child, or from childhood,’ {#बाल्यात्;#} ‘of
a race of kings, or descended from a race of kings,’ {#राज-#}
{#कुलात् प्रसूतः#} or {#राजकुलप्रसूतः#}. It may even be rendered
by the instr. c., in phrases where ‘by’ may be substituted
in English; as, ‘hospitably entertained of the king,’ {%i. e.%}
‘by the king,’ {#राज्ञा सत्कृतः#}. Where ‘of’ denotes ‘property,’
‘possession,’ ‘connexion with,’ ‘belonging to,’ &c., it may
either be expressed by the use of such words as {#सम्बन्धी#}
{#-न्धिनी#} &c., {#विषयः -या -यं, विषयकः#} &c., or by the gen. case, as
in some of the foregoing examples. Very frequently an
adjective compound involves some of these senses of the
preposition; as, ‘a bird of a red color,’ {#रक्तवर्णः पक्षी;#} ‘a man
of great valor,’ {#महावीर्य्यः पुरुषः;#} ‘a woman of great wealth,’
{#महाधना स्त्री#}. For the other senses of this preposition,
{%see%} ‘by,’ ‘from,’ ‘out,’ ‘among.’ ‘Of late,’ {#अर्वाक्, अर्वाक्काले,#}
{#नूतनकाले;#} ‘of old,’ {#पुरा, पुरस्तात्, पूर्व्वं, प्राक्काले;#} ‘son of a
grandson,’ {#प्रपौत्रः;#} ‘pupil of a pupil,’ {#प्रशिष्यः,#}
