<div n="lb"/>RĀHU¦, {%s.%} (The ascending node, fabled as a demon, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Singhikā, with the tail of a dragon. His head was
<div n="lb"/>cut off by Vishnu, at the churning of the ocean; but
<div n="lb"/>being immortal, by having tasted the amrit, the head
<div n="lb"/>and tail retained their separate existence, and were
<div n="lb"/>transferred to the stellar sphere. The head, or Rāhu,
<div n="lb"/>became the cause of eclipses, by endeavouring at various
<div n="lb"/>[Page653-a+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>times to swallow the sun and moon. The tail was
<div n="lb"/>called Ketu, or the descending node, {%see%} PLANET) {#राहुः,#}
