<div n="lb"/>ŚIVA¦, {%s.%} A celebrated Hindū God, the Destroyer of Creation,
<div n="lb"/>and therefore the most formidable of the Hindū Triad.
<div n="lb"/>He also personifies reproduction, since the Hindū philo-
<div n="lb"/>sophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without
<div n="lb"/>subsequent regeneration. Hence he is sometimes con-
<div n="lb"/>founded with Brahmā, the Creator, or first person of the
<div n="lb"/>Triad. He is the particular god of the Tāntṛkas, or
<div n="lb"/>followers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers
<div n="lb"/>are termed Śaivas, and although not so numerous as
<div n="lb"/>the Vaishnavas, exalt their god to the highest place in
<div n="lb"/>the heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes
<div n="lb"/>which properly belong to the other deities. According
<div n="lb"/>to them Śiva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the
<div n="lb"/>Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation,
<div n="lb"/>his type is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin probably of
<div n="lb"/>the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As the god
<div n="lb"/>of generation and of justice, which latter character he
<div n="lb"/>shares with the god Yama, he is represented riding
<div n="lb"/>a white bull. His own colour, as well as that of the
<div n="lb"/>bull, is generally white, referring probably to the un-
<div n="lb"/>sullied purity of Justice. His throat is dark blue; his
<div n="lb"/>hair of a light reddish colour, and thickly matted together,
<div n="lb"/>and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic.
<div n="lb"/>He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with
<div n="lb"/>four, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three
<div n="lb"/>eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead, pointing
<div n="lb"/>up and down. These are said to denote his view of the
<div n="lb"/>[Page747-a+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>three divisions of time, past, present, and future. He
<div n="lb"/>holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his
<div n="lb"/>relationship to water, or according to others, to show
<div n="lb"/>that the three great attributes of Creator, Destroyer,
<div n="lb"/>and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are
<div n="lb"/>enveloped in a tiger's skin. In his character of Time,
<div n="lb"/>he not only presides over its extinction, but also its as-
<div n="lb"/>tronomical regulation. A crescent or half-moon on his
<div n="lb"/>forehead indicates the measure of time by the phases
<div n="lb"/>of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to
<div n="lb"/>denote the measure of time by years, and a second neck-
<div n="lb"/>lace of human skulls marks the lapse and revolution of
<div n="lb"/>ages, and the extinction and succession of the generations
<div n="lb"/>of mankind. He is often represented as entirely
<div n="lb"/>covered with serpents, which are the emblems of immor-
<div n="lb"/>tality. They are bound in his hair, round his neck,
<div n="lb"/>wrists, waist, arms, and legs; they serve as rings for
<div n="lb"/>his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his con-
<div n="lb"/>stant companions. Śiva has more than a thousand
<div n="lb"/>names, which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth
<div n="lb"/>chapter of the Śiva Purāna. The following list of the
<div n="lb"/>principal of these will give the best idea of his character
