BALARĀMA¦. This god is not often regarded as an avatār of
Vishnu, but rather as an incarnation of the great ser-
pent Ananta; hence he is sometimes called {#शेषः#} or {#अनन्तः#}.
He was the son of Vasudeva by Devakī, but was trans-
ferred from the latter to the womb of Rohiṇī, the other
wife of Vasudeva, and hence his name, {#सङ्कर्षणः#}. Other

of the boxer Muṣṭika) {#मुष्टिकान्तकः#}. — (Secret in motion)
