‘Because’ may be often expressed by the abl. or inst. c.

of earth,’ {#मृदल्पत्वात्;#} ‘because he was a just man,’ {#सज्जन-#}
{#त्वात्;#} ‘because he was a friend,’ {#मित्रतया#}. It may even
be expressed by {#इति;#} thus, ‘I am come, because a ser-
vant ought to be present at the fitting occasion,’ {#अनुजी-#}
{#विना प्राप्तकाले सान्निध्यं कर्त्तव्यम् इति आगतोऽस्मि#}.
