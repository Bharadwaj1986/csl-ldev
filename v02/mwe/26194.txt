losophy) {#दर्शनः, तीर्थः#}. There are six schools or systems
of philosophy recognised by the Hindus, viz. 1. Pūrva Mī-
[Page714-a+ 51]
mānsā, {#पूर्व्वमीमांसा,#} founded by Jaimini, for the purpose of
illustrating and explaining the karmakānda, or ritual part
of the Vedas. It gives the rationale or meaning of the
ritual enjoined in those sacred books, as distinct from
the theological or spiritual part of them, and acknow-
ledges the principle of {#एकत्वं,#} or oneness, which it was
the object of the Vedānta system more fully to investi-
gate. 2. Sānkhya, {#सांख्यः,#} ascribed to the Muni Kapila.
This system is an attempt to account for the existence
of the universe without the Deity, by asserting the
principle of {#द्वैतं#} or duality, or, in other words, the co-ex-
istence of Spirit and matter. 3. Vedānta, {#वेदान्तः,#} or
Uttara Mīmānsā, {#उत्तरमीमांसा,#} said to have been founded by
Vyāsa, and subsequently fully developed by its most
celebrated teacher {#शङ्करः#} or {#शङ्कराचार्य्यः#}. This system is
wholly concerned with the theological and philosophical
part of the Vedas, or that part contained in the chapters
called Upanishads, and its teaching is intended to oppose
the duality of the Sānkhya system by shewing that the
end or aim of the Vedas is {#एकत्वं,#} or the oneness of
Spirit. It denies the co-existence of matter with Spirit,
and hence the conclusion arrived at is the non-existence
of any thing but God. 4. Nyāya, {#न्यायः,#} founded by the
inspired sage Gautama, and the most popular of all
the systems. It is neither so mystical as the Vedānta,
nor so fanciful as the Sānkhya. Its title signifies ‘the
fitness of things,’ and it may be described as an attempt
to treat of almost all subjects, according to a philosophical
method and logical arrangement. 5. Vaiśeṣika, {#वैशेषिकं,#}
a branch of the Nyāya, founded by the sage {#कणादः,#} to
supply what was incomplete in the aphorisms of Gautama.
6. Yoga, {#योगः#} or Pātanjala, {#पातञ्जलं,#} founded by the sage
{#पतञ्जलिः#} {%m.%} Its object is to shew that, even in the body,
there may be, to a great extent, union with the Supreme
Being. These philosophical systems are contained in
sacred writings called Ṣāstras. {%See%} the word.
