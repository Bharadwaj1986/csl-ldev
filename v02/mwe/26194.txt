<div n="lb"/>losophy) {#दर्शनः, तीर्थः#}. There are six schools or systems
<div n="lb"/>of philosophy recognised by the Hindus, viz. 1. Pūrva Mī-
<div n="lb"/>[Page714-a+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>mānsā, {#पूर्व्वमीमांसा,#} founded by Jaimini, for the purpose of
<div n="lb"/>illustrating and explaining the karmakānda, or ritual part
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedas. It gives the rationale or meaning of the
<div n="lb"/>ritual enjoined in those sacred books, as distinct from
<div n="lb"/>the theological or spiritual part of them, and acknow-
<div n="lb"/>ledges the principle of {#एकत्वं,#} or oneness, which it was
<div n="lb"/>the object of the Vedānta system more fully to investi-
<div n="lb"/>gate. 2. Sānkhya, {#सांख्यः,#} ascribed to the Muni Kapila.
<div n="lb"/>This system is an attempt to account for the existence
<div n="lb"/>of the universe without the Deity, by asserting the
<div n="lb"/>principle of {#द्वैतं#} or duality, or, in other words, the co-ex-
<div n="lb"/>istence of Spirit and matter. 3. Vedānta, {#वेदान्तः,#} or
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Mīmānsā, {#उत्तरमीमांसा,#} said to have been founded by
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa, and subsequently fully developed by its most
<div n="lb"/>celebrated teacher {#शङ्करः#} or {#शङ्कराचार्य्यः#}. This system is
<div n="lb"/>wholly concerned with the theological and philosophical
<div n="lb"/>part of the Vedas, or that part contained in the chapters
<div n="lb"/>called Upanishads, and its teaching is intended to oppose
<div n="lb"/>the duality of the Sānkhya system by shewing that the
<div n="lb"/>end or aim of the Vedas is {#एकत्वं,#} or the oneness of
<div n="lb"/>Spirit. It denies the co-existence of matter with Spirit,
<div n="lb"/>and hence the conclusion arrived at is the non-existence
<div n="lb"/>of any thing but God. 4. Nyāya, {#न्यायः,#} founded by the
<div n="lb"/>inspired sage Gautama, and the most popular of all
<div n="lb"/>the systems. It is neither so mystical as the Vedānta,
<div n="lb"/>nor so fanciful as the Sānkhya. Its title signifies ‘the
<div n="lb"/>fitness of things,’ and it may be described as an attempt
<div n="lb"/>to treat of almost all subjects, according to a philosophical
<div n="lb"/>method and logical arrangement. 5. Vaiśeṣika, {#वैशेषिकं,#}
<div n="lb"/>a branch of the Nyāya, founded by the sage {#कणादः,#} to
<div n="lb"/>supply what was incomplete in the aphorisms of Gautama.
<div n="lb"/>6. Yoga, {#योगः#} or Pātanjala, {#पातञ्जलं,#} founded by the sage
<div n="lb"/>{#पतञ्जलिः#} {%m.%} Its object is to shew that, even in the body,
<div n="lb"/>there may be, to a great extent, union with the Supreme
<div n="lb"/>Being. These philosophical systems are contained in
<div n="lb"/>sacred writings called Ṣāstras. {%See%} the word.
