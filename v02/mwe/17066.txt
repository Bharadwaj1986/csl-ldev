KĀRTIKEYA¦, {%s.%} (The god of war, or Hindu Mars, generated
from the vivifying principle of Śiva cast into Agni, or
Fire, who, unable to retain it, cast it into Gangā, or the
Ganges. On the banks of this river was born the
beautiful boy who was destined to lead the armies of
the gods, and to be the destroyer of Tāraka, a demon
who, by his austerities, had alarmed both gods and men,
and gained the dominion of the universe. When born,
Kārtikeya was nursed by six nymphs, called the Kritti-
kās, or Pleiades, who each called him her son, and, offer-
ing her breast, the child assumed to himself six mouths,
and received nurture from each. He is considered to
be the brother of Ganeśa, who was the reputed eldest
son of Śiva and Pārvatī. He is represented riding on
a peacock. (As having the six Kṛttikās for his foster-
