<div n="lb"/>viz. 1. Paraśu Rāma, or Rāma with the axe, the sixth
<div n="lb"/>avatār or incarnation of Vishnu. He was a Brahman,
<div n="lb"/>the son of the holy sage Jamadagni, and born at the begin-
<div n="lb"/>ning of the second or Treta age, for the purpose of
<div n="lb"/>repressing the tyranny, and punishing the violence of

<div n="lb"/>the class of Brahmans, and their contest with the Ksha-
<div n="lb"/>triyas. Some of his names are {#परशुरामः -मकः, परशुधरः, पर्शुरामः,#}
<div n="lb"/>{#जमदग्निसुतः, जामदग्न्यः#}. 2. Rāmachandra or the moon-like
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. He was
<div n="lb"/>born into the world as the son of Daśaratha, king of
<div n="lb"/>Oude, and great grandson of Raghu, at the close of the
<div n="lb"/>second or Treta age, for the purpose of destroying the
<div n="lb"/>demons who infested the earth, and especially Rāvana, the

<div n="lb"/>nation of Vishnu. He was born at the end of the Dvā-
<div n="lb"/>para, or third age, as the seventh son of Vasudeva and
<div n="lb"/>Devakī, and therefore elder brother of Krishna, but was
<div n="lb"/>transferred from the womb of Devakī to that of Rohinī
<div n="lb"/>the other wife of Vasudeva. Hence one of his names
